[City Hall in the Mayor’s room. Scene of the crime, player and Vermont are in the mayor’s office. The three are standing over an outline of where Hoppins was found with other officers in the background.]

VERMONT
…I’m sorry things had to end this way, Arthur… 
Madam, was there anyone else here at the scene of the crime?

MADAM HOPPINS
My daughter Kale was the one who found him here. 
I’m sure she could help with that.

KALE
…
                 
VERMONT
Hello there, I’m Inspector Vermont. 
You must be Kale, it’s a pleasure to meet you.

KALE
…
                 
MADAM HOPPINS
It’s okay dear, they’re only here to help. 
Would you like to speak to the detectives?

KALE
	I’m okay with talking to them. 
I want to help with this case too.

MADAM HOPPINS
Thank you dear, if you ever get uncomfortable just let me know.

[ OPTIONS: Mayor Hoppins | Did you see anyone?]
                 
KALE [1]:
You mean my dad? 
That night, it was getting close to midnight so my mom told me to get my dad so we can all eat at the dinner table. 
When I got there, the room was dark and the windows were open so there were puddles of water all over the floor. 
I figured dad must’ve fallen asleep at his desk again, so I went to close the windows and wake him up…I tried nudging him to wake him up, but he didn’t move. 
His body flipped to the side, and he was limp without a sign of life in his eyes. 
I ran to mom and that was all I saw.

KALE [2]
When I went to check on him, I didn’t notice anyone there at the time. All I remember was seeing him…lying there.

KALE[3]
I don’t feel so good…

VERMONT
I’m so sorry to hear that.

KALE
	Sorry, Detective…I have to go…

[Kale leaves the room]

MADAM HOPPINS
She’s going through a lot right now, please forgive her.

VERMONT
It’s not a problem Ms. Hoppins. I’m sure this must’ve been a lot to take in on a regular night. 
[Player] and I will inspect the area for clues.

MADAM HOPPINS
Of course, I shall leave it to you both

[MADAM HOPPINS leaves the office for the two to inspect the area]

[OPTIONS: Window | Door | Desk | Bookshelves | Floor]

[If floor is chosen]

VERMONT
What’s this? Coffee grinds? 
Must’ve come from the mayor’s coffee mug. (They smell them) 
These are still fresh, and I don’t see any signs of a coffee maker in here. Not sure how useful this will be but let’s hang on to this. 

[PLAYER RECEIVES NEW EVIDENCE] 

VERMONT
I think that should be everything, let’s see if we can find anyone else to speak to about this incident.

[Player gets option to go outside if needed]

Panel 1: The Parking Lot

VERMONT
Huh…No one’s here. Well since were already outside let’s see if we can find anything out of place. 
The mayor’s office window is just above here so the culprit must have jumped through the window and landed here.

[Player has option to scout the area. If sidewalk is chosen:]

VERMONT
Did you find something?
?!	
A foot prints. And it looks like its engraved in the cement, and from the looks of it… this print is right above the window.

??
Hey you there! You can’t be here.

VERMONT
Apologies for the disturbance, were here on behalf of a request from the mayor’s wife. We wont be long. 

??
The Hoppins’ huh?
Well, im under a request from the Hoppins too, fixin’ that there sidewalk. 

VERMONT
Im sorry, and who might you be?

DIESEL
Diesel, a contractor, I work here. And you are?

VERMONT
I’m Inspector Vermont and this is my partner [Player]	Were here to…

DIESEL
I’m going to have to stop you right there. 
I heard about the mayor and the whole kerfuffle but you’re stepping on wet cement there bud.

[Vermont scrambles to get out and wipe their feet]

DIESEL
No one reads the signs these days. 
It’s bad enough I have to lay a fresh coat after some idiot messed up the last one.

VERMONT
You mean the footprint?

DIESEL
Yeah, see. 
The sidewalk needs a bit of polishin.’
People have been complaining nowadays about tripping on the thing they hired me to fix it.

[Player Options: Where were you | Who do you work for?]

DIESEL
[If asked: Who do you work for?]	
Listen pal, enough with the questions. 
I’m just here to grab my coffee, lay out cement and go home. Don’t want any part of this mayor thing.

VERMONT
I understand. Could we perhaps keep this piece here?

DIESEL
Do whatever you want, just get out of here.

[Player receives footprint and gets kicked out to the city street]

VERMONT
Well, that was pleasant. I know I’m new here, but I’ve never seen their face before.
No matter, the footprint we retrieved seems to have come from someone of the avian kind. This is just a hunch but we need to look into this a bit further. That Diesel guy seems a bit suspicious but with this clue, things don’t really add up on his end. 

[Player has a chance to look through evidence]

VERMONT
All we have are a few coffee beans and a footprint. 
Given from the looks of it the culprit must have been an avian of some kind. 

[Player Option 3]

VERMONT
Your right, no sense standing here thinking.

Panel 1: Wild Roost Cafe

[The player and Vermont enter the café and gets started by a loud squawk]

??
Number 94, Caramel Latte, extra cream, hold the sugar!

VERMONT
??

[A chatty barista is spotted behind the register]

CYRUS
There you go Ma’am, thank you for coming to the Wild Roost, enjoy your day! 
Next in line!

VERMONT
Hi, Can I have a Large Green tea, no sugar please. 
What would you like [Player]
                 
[Player] will have [ Choice]

CYRUS
Sure thing, would you like this for here or to-go?

VERMONT
Here please.

CYRUS
Alrighty!
Here's your number, feel free to have a seat and we’ll let you know when your order’s ready!

VERMONT
Thank you

[Player and Vermont sit at table with their table number erect on the table]

VERMONT
Not a fan of coming to this place, it smells weird.

[Player OPTIONS 4]

VERMONT
I’ve only visited Wild Roost once since ive moved to the island. 
For some reason, the coffee just wreaks… I’ve had coffee elsewhere, but this café is just, not for me	
Although that barista… noticed anything weird about them [Player]?

[Player OPTION 4, #2: mentions their feet]

VERMONT
Precisely, they’re an avian with a similar footprint to the evidence we retrieved at Town Hall. We should speak to them

[Player OPTION 6]

CYRUS
There you go, one green tea and a [Drink choice]

VERMONT
This is a stunning design, sir, did you make this?

CYRUS
Oh, thank you I did, I’ve been working on my technique since I started working here *squawk*

VERMONT
Please, do take a seat with us. 
We’d love to learn more.

[Cyrus hesitates momentarily but eagerly sits down ready to share his knowledge on coffee]

CYRUS
I probably shouldn’t stay too long, I am in the middle of my shift… there’s probably a few customers waiting in line too.

VERMONT
It seems it’s just us for the time being. I insist.

[Cyrus squawks then take a seat]
[Vermont sips they’re drink.]

VERMONT
I usually make my own tea at home, but this is well done. 
Is this a popular drink here?

CYRUS
Thank you and yeah it is, we usually have a bunch of customers coming in for it. 
But our most popular drink is our espresso.

VERMONT
People really love their coffee.

[Cyrus squawk in excitement]

CYRUS
Would you blame them, it’s so popular even Kale Hoppins stops by for her morning brew!
Haven’t seen her in a while though, hope she’s okay. 
Probably running around the woods again.

VERMONT
You know Kale?

CYRUS
Yeah, she’s a regular here!
We chat every now and then, she usually stops by after visiting the salon across the street. On my morning hikes, shes usually hanging out in the trees too, living her best life.

VERMONT
You watched her cross the street?

CYRUS
Well yeah, it is a glass window. 
Usually see people pass by all the time, some even stop by to get a drink.

VERMONT
Strange that people get so excited over just some coffee.

CYRUS
It’s not JUST any coffee this is an exotic imported coffee from off the island!
Beans grown here are too sweet. Folks really love the new imported brand because it’s just the right blend of sweet and bitter. 
R.A Coffee is one of a kind and were honestly having a hard time keeping our shelves stocked ha-ha

VERMONT
R.A?

Cyrus
Its short for Raven’s Ash. Funny sounding name so people just say RAH, instead!

[Vermont taps at Player to look down at Cyrus’s feet and take a picture.]

[Picture acquired]

VERMONT
Do you know where it’s from?

CYRUS
I only know it is imported. 
Though I heard a new coffee plant is being built just off the outskirts of town. 
It’s been pretty empty so I’m glad something new is happening around here.

MANAGER
Cyrus, we've got customers coming in!

CYRUS
That’s my queue. It was nice talking to you all. 
Enjoy your drink

[Cyrus leaves the table.]

[Player]
Why did you make me take a picture of their feet?

VERMONT
While they are avian, I didn’t want to scare them off by mentioning the murder and showing evidence. 	Don’t look at me like that! It’s clearly needed for our investigation!	Plus, she’s a civilian. We shouldn’t be running around causing mass panic just because were looking for a murderer. The best thing we can do is to keep the peace as best as we can. 
                 
                 
[Player shows pictures side by side]

VERMONT
The toe on the engraving is vastly different from that young barista. The nails on the print were well trimmed too. While the hunch about the suspect being avian may be leading us in an interesting direction. We’re not making much progress…	The barista had mentioned that Kale stops by here after their spa. Kind of grasping at straws here but I think our next best bet is to check it out.

CHAPTER 1

[Case reading | Mayor’s office, City Hall: 11 PM]

It was a cold windy day as a storm was beginning to brew after a long week of summer head. A silhouette looms behind the mayor’s desk revealing a pale body of the once beloved mayor. That night, the curtains were left open allowing the enthusiastic rain to soak the mayor on the spot. His body discovered by his daughter Kale who has reached out to him to return for dinner. No evidence was discovered in the scene of the crime.

[Scene reveals to be the police station]

CHIEF
What kind of bastard would do such a thing? 
And here I thought this town was finally becoming peaceful for a change. 
Ma’am, do you remember anything else from that night?

MADAM HOPPINS
Not that I know of… my daughter was the one who found him…
I am sure she can provide more details but, right now… we would like some alone time.
I am sure you understand, chief.

CHIEF
Yes, of course. I understand.

[The chief packs up and heads out to of the room to investigate the area further but was stopped by Madam Hoppins.]

MADAM HOPPINS
Chief.

CHIEF
Yes, Madam?

MADAM HOPPINS
The person who’s done this has disrupted the balance of not only this town but the lives of this family. My husband was a peaceful man who saw potential in this town and cared for its townsfolk as if they were his own family.  I want you to find whoever did this and see that they receive the same punishment by any means necessary.

CHIEF
Understood.

[Chief leaves city hall to return to the police station]

CHIEF
…Unbelievable. 
First, folks in town have gone missing and now the mayor?!
Things are getting out of hand.

[The chief looks at the piles of papers stacked on their desks looking defeated]

[Player Options #1] 

CHIEF
?!
Oh you, I did not see you there. 
Sorry, my memory is still a bit fuzzy…what was your name again?

[Player inserts name]

CHIEF
Ah yes, [player]. Your new here, aren’t you? 
You have come at the right time, detective. 
I am sure you have already heard of what happened in city hall… 
The entire station is backed up and we could you as much help as we can get.

[Player Options #2] 

Chief [ If options 1 or 2]

CHIEF [IF OPTION 3]:
	?! I will not tolerate such disrespect in my office. The force has been working hard to ensure that the townsfolk feel safe for generations to come. And I will not allow some spoiled, asshole from the city poison this town’s safety with your attitude.

CHIEF [AFTERWARDS]:
Anyway, your still new here so I cannot just trust a new detective from the out of town for such a hefty case. 
Here take this, I need you to go to this address and look for this person. 
They just retirement but given their track record, would be the best person for this job. 
I need you to track them down and make them take the case. With all the distractions we have at the station, we need a seasoned point of view to solve this case. 
Will you, do it?

[IF PLAYER AGREES]

CHIEF
Perfect, knew I can count on you! 
Good luck and DON’T let me down. 

[ Case File received.]

Panel 1: Vermont's Garden

[Pans to the street sign with address in case] 

[ It was bright, open sky on this wonderful Saturday morning. Lush fruitful trees, colorful flowers dancing in the wind, not a worry in sight on this beautiful day.]

[PLAYER]
This must be the place.

[ The player walks up to a beautiful garden with trees and wide variety of flowers. Curious they stop to smell the flowers and appreciate the scenery.]

??:	
Enjoying the Magnolias?
                 
[PLAYER]
?!

[A tall elderly lion appeared behind you. They are wearing a flowery apron and wreak of roses.]

??
Those are magnolias, one of my prized flowers. 
They were a gift from an old friend.

[PLAYER]
They are gorgeous, I do not think I have seen these types of flowers on the island.

??
Excellent observation, they are native on another island not too far from here, but I do appreciate the compliment, [ Player].

[PLAYER]
How did you???

??
	It is a small town. It is not hard to know who is ‘who’ is around here. 
Oh, where are my manners, I am Vermont the owner of this garden.

[PLAYER]
I am Detective [Player].

VERMONT
Pleasure to meet you detective [Player]. What brings you here?

[PLAYER]
I am here under order from chief to deliver this to this address. 

[Vermont receives the case papers]

VERMONT
…	
Would you like some lemonade? Walking here must have been exhausting and I could use a glass myself.

[PLAYER]
I am sorry, madam but my orders were to give this to you.
 I should return to the station

VERMONT
I insist please come in

[Player enters Vermont’s living room]

[The room has a strong tropical appearance with lots of potted plants and a wood stove. Its small yet cozy. Vermont sits with you with a glass of lemonade.]

[PLAYER]
I appreciate the hospitality but…

VERMONT
Do you need help with the mayor’s murder case?

[PLAYER]
The chief does not trust me with a case this big, so they are requesting help from you it seems.

VERMONT
I see, I am sorry but I can’t take the case. 
I have retired and have been out of the field for years. I came to this town to get away from it all and relax after all these years. Apologies, but you will have to notify your chief that I must deny this request. 

[PLAYER]
Please ma’am. 
This is not just a regular case; the livelihood of the whole town is at stake. 

[The player and Vermont were interrupted by MADAM HOPPINS who appears with bodyguards standing right by the room door]

MADAM HOPPINS
I am afraid the young detective is correct.

BOTH VERMONT AND PLAYER
	?!

MADAM HOPPINS
The townsfolk are feeling restless after the assassination of my husband. 
And I fear things are getting worse.

[MADAM HOPPINS gives more reports of missing people in town]
                 
MADAM HOPPINS
People are going Missing Vermont and the police…they will not disclose this to the public but even they are fearful of their own lives to do anything about it. 

VERMONT
This has nothing to do with me.

MADAM HOPPINS
That may be so, but this is not just a regular late night bar quarrel. 
This is real, Vermont. If the town’s police are too busy to do anything, I can only trust a true professional to manage this case. You came to this town to finally have your freedom and I respect that but please, please help us Inspector Vermont.

[ Vermont reflects on the decision and looks at MADAM HOPPINS who reminds her of her ex-wife and stands up]

VERMONT
MADAM HOPPINS... Ill investigate this case, rest assured. I will do whatever I get to the bottom of it.

MADAM HOPPINS
Thank you…
Thank you Inspector...

[Player looks on and was interrupted by Vermont]

VERMONT
[Player] would you like to join me on this case? I will need the help of familiar face if we are to get to the bottom of this.

[Player hesitates but agrees]

[ Vermont dawns their coat and join the player as they return to city hall to begin their investigation]

[Vermont and player rush into the salon]

Vermont
Hello, is anyone here?

Pudding
Detective? Your back, what’s wrong?

Vermont
Nothing of concern but I need to speak to your manager.

Pudding
Phara? She just left its closing hour, so she left me to clean up shop.

Vermont
Do you know when she’ll be back.

Pudding
I don’t know. She always leaves early and she’s not the type to share her personal business.

Vermont
I see, mind if we wait around while in case she comes back?

Pudding
Of course!

[Player and Vermont wait out at the front of the salon]

Vermont
I think we’re starting to get the big picture here [Player]
Just as Monty mentioned, we have a prime suspect in the wait, but we can’t just barge in and make accusations. We have to figure out how to expose this man for who he truly is and fast.

[Vermont picks up on the smell again and sees a shadowy figure in the distance]

Vermont
Over there!

[Player and Vermont pick up on the scent and book it towards the pier]

Vermont
Wait, stop!

[ The figure dives into the water and Vermont follows suit. The figure then grabs Vermont’s leg and pulls him down. Unable to breathe Vermont struggles to swim up to the surface and is then rescued by Monty]

Monty
The hell are you doing out here!

Vermont
Cough. I was close

Monty
Are you nuts?! You can’t swim, you could’ve drowned.

Vermont
Monty, I saw them!

MontyWhat?

Vermont
The person who smelled of meat and roses.
We chased them all the way to the pier, and they jumped into the ocean…did you see them?

Monty
Sorry, detective. I was in the shack I didn’t even see anyone jump in.

Vermont
DAMN. And we were so close too.

Monty
Perhaps you should rest a bit.

Vermont
NO. 
This case has gone on long enough, don’t you see.
Like you said, people are going missing, that crazy chicken threatened to kill me and I nearly drowned. 

Monty
Listen.
I know this is tough but you gotta keep it together man. 
I’ll help however way I can, you have me and player to help as well.
What did you both see?

Vermont
I saw a figure with a long tail jumping in with a sack.

Monty
The water…that must’ve been the reason I’ve been the only one who’s noticed that weird smell. Whomever did this know what they were doing and had the experience behind it.

Vermont
There was a trail that they left while we chased them…

Monty
Alright, lets follow the trail and see where it leads.

Vermont
You’re coming with us?

Monty
You’re going to need all the help you can get.

[The three follow the trail that leads to near the cafe]

Vermont
Stay here Monty, Player and I have a few questions we need to ask.

[Vermont enters the cafe]

Cyrus
Vermont, it’s good to see you again!

Vermont
Wonderful to see you as well Cyrus, how’s everything.

Cyrus
Nothing out of the usual, just the same old.

Vermont
I saw you just the other day with Orion.

Cyrus
Oh him? Yeah, we were just chatting about the usual business. A friend of his stopped by with another sack of those special coffee beans.

Vermont
Aside from said friend do you know where he got these beans.

Cyrus
They’re imported from what I’m told but between you and me.
Mr. Orion said that since business has been booming with these new beans that he’s planning on building a coffee plant for the town!

Vermont
A coffee plant!

Cyrus
Yeah! And he said he’ll make me the manager of it once its ready!
Isn’t that exciting!

Vermont
Interesting, so Orion is the one behind these beans.

Cyrus
That’s right!
Care for a sample?!

Vermont
You know what, maybe I will. Thank you

[Vermont takes a cup and leaves the shop]

Vermont
…

[Vermont takes a sip of the coffee]

Vermont
Cough cough, ahahahaha!! This is great, woo!

Monty
You alright?

Vermont
Never felt so good! Monty wants me to do anything for you buddy?!
I’ll do anything!

Monty
The matter with you???

[Player splashes them with water]

Vermont
What happened?

Monty
You drank that sample and went full on crazy.
As if you were addicted to the stuff. Have you had coffee before?

Vermont
I’m not the biggest fan of it but… if what you said is true then…
We’re going to Orion.

Monty
What?

Vermont
We never got the chance to properly speak to him… Monty, I won’t make you come along if you aren’t comfortable. 

Monty
Ill follow the trail from earlier, you can go on ahead. 

Vermont
Alright. [Player] this is our last shot. I don’t know who this man is… but if what Kale said is true, we MUST be on our toes. He’s the only one in town we haven’t spoken with… it’s all or nothing.

[Vermont storms off with Player back to the condominiums]

Vermont
Were here but where the hell could he be…

[Vermont rings the doorbell then a shadowy figure knocks them both out]

Panel 1: Murder Trial and The Assignment

CHAPTER 1

[Case reading | Mayor’s office, City Hall: 11 PM]

It was a cold windy day as a storm was beginning to brew after a long week of summer head. A silhouette looms behind the mayor’s desk revealing a pale body of the once beloved mayor. That night, the curtains were left open allowing the passionate rain to soak the mayor on the spot. His body was discovered by his daughter Kale who has reached out to him to return for dinner. No evidence was found in the scene of the crime.

[Scene reveals to be the police station]

CHIEF:	What kind of bastard would do such a thing. And here I thought this town was finally getting peaceful. 	Ma’am, do you or your son remember anything else that night?

MADAM HOPPIN:	Not that I know of my daughter was the one who…found him. I’m sure she can provide more details, however. 	Right now, we’d like to be left alone, we’ve already have enough on our plate as is chief.

CHIEF:	I understand madam

MADAM HOPPIN:	Chief.

CHIEF:
Yes, Madam?

MADAM HOPPIN:	I want you to find whoever did this and bring them to me at any 	means necessary. They have disrupted the balance of not only this town but the lives of this family. He was a peaceful man who was selfless and cared for this town for years…Stop at nothing until the monster who did this gets the punishment they deserve.

CHIEF:	I understand.

[Chief leaves city hall to return to the police station]

CHIEF:	…Unbelievable. Were already piled on with missing cases and ow the mayor’s dead. Things are getting out of hand.

[OPTIONS ACTIVE (See comments)]

CHIEF:	?!	Oh you, I didn’t see you there. Sorry, my memory is still fuzzy what was your name again?

[Player inserts name]

CHIEF:	Ah yes, [player]. Your new here, aren’t you? You’ve come at the right time detective. I’m sure you’ve already heard of what happened in city hall… The entire station is backed up and we could you as much help as we can get.

[OPTIONS ACTIVE (See comments)]

Chief [ If options 1 or 2]

CHIEF [IF OPTION 3]:	?! I will not tolerate such disrespect in my office. The force has been working hard to ensure that the townsfolk feel safe for generations to come. And I won’t allow some spoiled, asshole from the city poison this town’s safety with your attitude.

CHIEF [AFTERWARDS]:	Anyway, your still new here so I can’t just trust a new detective from the academy for such a hefty case. Here take this, I need you to go to this address and look for this person. They just got off retirement but the best person for this job. I need you to track them down and make them take the case. With all the distractions we have at the station, we need a seasoned point of view to solve this case. Will you, do it?

[ OPTIONS ACTIVE (See comments)]

CHIEF:	Perfect, knew I can count on you! Good luck and don’t let me down. 

[ Case File received.]

(1 panel)

Panel 1: Vermont's Garden

[Pans to the street sign with address in case] 

It was bright, clear sky on this wonderful Saturday morning. Lush fruitful trees, colorful flowers dancing in the wind, not a worry in sight on this beautiful day. 

[PLAYER]:	This must be the place.

The player walks up to a beautiful garden with trees and flowers of many a variety. Curious they stop to smell the flowers and appreciate the scenery.

??:	Magnolias.
                 
[PLAYER]:
?!

A tall smiling deer appeared behind you. They’re wearing a flowery apron and wreak of roses.

??:	Those are magnolias, one of my prized flowers. They were a gift from an old friend.

[PLAYER]:	They are gorgeous, I don’t think I’ve seen these types of flowers on the island.

??:	Excellent observation detective, they are native in another island not too far from here, but I do appreciate the flattery.

[PLAYER]:	How did you???

??:	It’s a small town, dear. Its not hard to know who is who around here. Oh, mind my manners, I’m Vermont the owner of this garden.

[PLAYER]:
I’m [Player].

VERMONT:
Pleasure to meet you detective [Player]. What brings you here?

[PLAYER]:	I’m here under order from chief to deliver this to this address. 

[Vermont receives the case papers]

VERMONT:	…	Would you like some lemonade? Walking here must have been 	exhausting and I could use a glass myself.

[PLAYER]:	I’m sorry, madam but my orders were to give this to you. I should return to the station

VERMONT:	I insist please come in

[Player enters room]

[The room has a strong tropical appearance with lots of potted plants and a wood stove. Its small yet cozy. Vermont sits with you with a glass of lemonade.]

[PLAYER]:	I appreciate the hospitality but…

VERMONT:
You need help with the mayor’s murder case?

[PLAYER]:	The chief doesn’t trust me with a case this big, so they’re requesting help from you it seems.

VERMONT:	I see, I’m sorry but I can’t take the case. I’m retired and have been out of the field for years. I came to this town to finally find some peace. Please tell your Chief that I respectfully decline. This is none of my business and I don’t want anymore stress in my life.

[PLAYER]:	Please ma’am. This isn’t just a regular case; the livelihood of the whole town is at stake. 

[MADAM HOPPIN appears with several bodyguards]

MADAM HOPPIN:	I’m afraid the young detective is correct.

BOTH VERMONT AND PLAYER:	?!

MADAM HOPPIN	The townsfolk are feeling restless after the assassination of my husband. And I fear things are getting worse.

[MADAM HOPPIN gives more reports of missing people in town]
                 
MADAM HOPPIN:	People are going Missing Vermont and the police are fearful of their own lives to do anything about it. 

VERMONT:
This has nothing to do with me.

MADAM HOPPIN:	That may be so, but this isn’t just a regular late night bar quarrel. This is real, Vermont. If the police won’t do anything, I can only trust a true professional to handle this case. You came to this town to finally have your freedom and I respect that but please, please help us Inspector Vermont.

[ Vermont reflects on the decision and looks at MADAM HOPPIN who reminds her of her ex-wife and stands up]

VERMONT:	MADAM HOPPIN. I humbly accept your case. Ill do whatever I get to the bottom of it.

MADAM HOPPIN:	Thank you…Thank you Inspector...

[Player looks on and was stopped by Vermont]

VERMONT:	[Player] would you like to join me on this case? Ill need the help of familiar face if we are to get to the bottom of this.

[Player hesitates but agrees]

[ This is the beginning of a journey of reckoning]

Panel 1: 
CHAPTER 2

[Scene of the crime, player and Vermont are in the mayor’s office]

VERMONT:	…I’m sorry things had to end this way, Ribbert. Was there anyone else here at the scene of the crime?

MADAM HOPPIN:	My daughter Kale was the one who found him here. I’m sure she could help with that.

KALE:	…
                 
VERMONT:	Hello there, I’m Inspector Vermont, I’m here to solve this case. You must be Kale, it’s a pleasure to meet you.

KALE:
…
                 
MADAM HOPPIN:	Its okay dear, they’re only here to help. Would you like to speak to the nice detectives? Or would you like to go outside?

KALE:	I’m ok with talking to them. I want to help with this case too.
MADAM HOPPIN:	Thank you dear, if you ever get uncomfortable just let me know.

[ OPTIONS: Mayor Hoppins | Did you see anyone?]
                 
KALE [1]:	You mean my dad? That night, it was getting close to midnight so my mom told me to get my dad so we can all eat at the dinner table. When I got there the room was dark and the windows were open so there were puddles of water all over the floor. I figured dad must’ve fallen asleep at his desk again, so I went to close the windows and wake him up…I tried nudging him to wake him up, but he didn’t move. His body flipped to the side, and he was limp without a sign of life in his eyes. I rushed to mom and that was all I saw.

KALE [2]:	When I went to check on him, I didn’t notice anyone there at the time. All I remember was seeing him…lying there.

VERMONT:
I’m so sorry to hear that.

KALE:	I have to go

[Kale leaves the room]

MADAM HOPPIN:	She’s going through a lot right now, please forgive her

VERMONT:	Its not a problem Ms. Hoppins. I’m sure this must’ve been a lot to take in on a regular night. [Player] and I will inspect the area for clues.

MADAM HOPPIN:	Of course, I shall leave it to you both

[MADAM HOPPIN leaves the office for the two to inspect the area]

[OPTIONS: Window | Door | Desk | Bookshelves | Floor]

[If floor is chosen]

VERMONT:	What’s this? Coffee grinds? Must’ve come from the mayor’s coffee mug. (They smell them) 	These are still fresh, and I don’t see any signs of a coffee maker in here. Not sure how useful this will be but let’s hang on to this. 

[PLAYER RECEIVES NEW EVIDENCE] 

VERMONT:	I think that should be everything, lets see if we can find anyone else to speak to about this incident.

[Player gets option to go outside if needed]



FOUR
(1 panel)

Panel 1: The Drive through

VERMONT:	Huh…No ones here. Well since were already outside lets see if we can find anything out of place. The mayor’s office is just above here so the culprit must have jumped through the window and landed here.

[Player has option to scout the area. If side walk is chosen:]

VERMONT:	Did you find something?	?!	A foot print? And it looks like it got engraved in the cement

??:	Hey you there! You cant be here.

VERMONT:	Apologies, who might you be?

DIESEL:	Diesel, a contractor, I work here. And you are?

VERMONT:	Im Inspector Vermont and this is my partner [Player]	Were here to…

DIESEL:	Im gonna have to stop you right there. I heard about the mayor and the whole kerfuffle but your stepping on wet cement there bud.

[Vermont scrambles to get out and wipe their hooves]

DIESEL:	No one reads the signs these days. Its bad enough I have to lay a fresh coat after some idiot messed up the last one.

VERMONT:	You mean the footprint?

DIESEL:	Yeah, see. The sidewalk needs a bit of polishin’. People have been complaining nowadays so I was hired to rework the thing.

[Player Options: Where were you | Who do you work for?]

DIESEL:	[If asked: Who do you work for?]	Listen pal, enough with the questions. 	Im just here to grab my coffee, lay out cement and go home. Don’t want any part of this mayor thing

VERMONT:	I understand. Could we perhaps keep this piece here?

DIESEL:	Do whatever you want, just get out of here.

[Player receives footprint and gets kicked out to the city street]

VERMONT:	Well that was pleasant. I know Im new here but Ive never seen there face before.	At least we retrieved more evidence, we couldn’t find anything else on the scene….

[Player has a chance to look through evidence]

VERMONT:	All we have are a few coffee beans and a footprint. 	Given from the looks of it the culprit must have been an avian of some kind. 

[Player: Lets stop at the café]

VERMONT:	Your right, no sense standing here thinking.


FIVE
(1 panel)
Panel 1: Wild Roost Cafe

[The player and Vermont enter the café and gets started by a loud squawk]

??:	Number 94, Caramel Latter extra cream hold the sugar!

VERMONT:	Wow, wasn’t what I was prepared for.

[A chatty barista is spotted behind the register]

CYRUS:	There you go Ma’am, thank you for coming to the Wild Roost, enjoy your day! Next in line!

VERMONT:	Hi, Can I have a Large Green tea, no sugar please. What would you like [Player]
                 
[Player] will have [ Choice]

CYRUS:	Sure thing, would you like this for here or to-go?

VERMONT:	Here please

CYRUS:	Here's your number, we’ll deliver your order to your seat when ready!

VERMONT:	Thank you

[Player and Vermont sit at table with their table number erect on the table]

VERMONT:	Not a fan of coming to this place, it smells weird.

[Player: Smells fine to me. | Is it the coffee | That’s weird]

VERMONT:	Ive been here before since I moved.	For some reason the coffee just wreaks… Ive had coffee else where but this café is just, not for me	Although that barista… noticed anything weird about them [Player]

[Player mentions their feet]

VERMONT:	Precisely, theyre an avian with an similar footprint to the evidence we retrieved at Town Hall. We should speak to them

[Player: We should leave them alone | Invite them to the table | Just enjoy your drink]

CYRUS:	There you go, one green tea and a [Drink choice]

VERMONT:
This is a stunning design, sir, did you make this?

CYRUS:	Oh thank you I did, Ive been working on my technique since I started working here *squawk*

VERMONT:	Please, do take a seat with us. We’d love to learn more.

[Cyrus hesitates]

CYRUS:	I should probably get back, theres probably a few customers waiting in line.

VERMONT:	It seems its just us. I insist.

[Cyrus squawks then take a seat]
[Vermont sips theyre drink.]

VERMONT:	A fine brew sir. I usually make my own tea at home but this is well done. Is this a popular drink here?

CYRUS:	Thank you and yeah it is, we usually have a bunch of customers coming in for it. But our most popular drink is our expresso

VERMONT:	People really love their coffee here

[Cyrus squawk in excitement]

CYRUS:	Would you blame them, its so popular even Kale stops by for her morning brew. Havent seen her in a while though, hope she’s okay. Probably meditating in the forest again.

VERMONT:	You know Kale?

CYRUS:	Yeah, she’s a regular here! 	We chat every now and then, she usually stops by after visiting the salon across the street. 

VERMONT:	You watched her cross the street?

CYRUS:	Well yeah, it is a glass window. Usually see people pass by all the time, some even stop by to get a drink.

VERMONT:	Strange that people get so excited over just some coffee.

CYRUS:	Its not JUST any coffee this is an exotic imported coffee from off the island!	Beans grown here are too sweet. Folks really love the new imported brand because its just the right blend of sweet and bitter. [ ] Coffee is one of a kind and were honestly having a hard time keeping our shelves stocked haha

[Vermont taps at Player to look down at Cyrus’s feet and take a picture.]

[Picture acquired]

VERMONT:
Do you know where its from?

CYRUS:	Unfortunately, I only know its imported. Though I heard a new coffee plant is being built just off the outskirts of town. Its been pretty empty so Im glad something new is happening around here.

MANAGER:	Cyrus, we've got customers coming in!

CYRUS:	That’s my queue. It was nice talking to you all. Enjoy your drink

[Cyrus leaves the table.]

[Player: Why did you make me take a picture of their feet?]

VERMONT:	While they are avian, I didn’t want to scare them off by mentioning the murder and showing evidence. 	Dont look at me like that! Its clearly needed for our investigation!	Plus, she’s a civilian. We shouldn’t be running around causing mass panic just because were looking for a murderer. The best thing we can do is to keep the peace as best as we can. 
                 
                 
[Player shows pictures side by side]

VERMONT:	The toes on the engraving is vastly different from that young barista. The nails on the print were well trimmed too. While the hunch about the suspect being avian may be leading us in an interesting direction. Were not making much progress…	The barista had mentioned that Kale stops by here after their spa. Kind of grasping at straws here but I think our next best bet is to check it out.

CH 3

[Vermont and their assistant make their way to the salon just a few blocks from the cafe. There they are greeted with melodious chimes from the door and met the receptionist]

VERMONT:	Hi, Inspector Vermont with the local Police. Id like to speak with you regarding intel on a regular at your salon.

PHARA:	Oh no no no no. Not here.	I'm tired of your police folk coming in here interrupting my business.

VERMONT:	This town's really friendly... Im sorry ma'am, we'll be out of your way shortly, we just need to speak to someone for a moment.

PHARA:	If ya aint here for business then I suggest you leave.

VERMONT:	Oh dear... we need to speak to a few people in the area but the receptionist isnt the friendliest. How do we do this?

[ Player Options]

VERMONT:	Good idea!	Ma'am, would it be possible to have a quick pedicure while were here. My colleague and I have been walking quite a bit and it would be nice to treat ourselves even for just a few minutes.

PHARA:	Hmm... I dont trust ya but my shop needs the customers...Fine. Sit over there and Ill have Puddin' take care of yah. 

[ Vermont and player are escorted to their chairs to get their pedicure]

PUDDING:	Welcome.

VERMONT:	Oh hello there!

PUDDING:	Pedicure for two? Feet in the tray please. 

VERMONT:	You must be pudding its a pleasure to meet you.

PUDDING:	...

VERMONT:	I take it that im not welcomed here. [Player] could you help me out with this situation?	We need as much intel as possible and I take it that they trust you more.

[PLAYER SECTION:
(Option 1: Pleasure to meet you Pudding!
Pudding: Hello
Option 2: How long have you worked here?	Pudding: Ive worked here all my life. I care for big people.	Player: Big People?	Pudding: Large folk with claws and sharp teeth.	Vermont: Ah, strange that she describes people like that...	Option 3: What do you do outside of work?	Pudding: I...don't really go anywhere. This job is all Im good 		at. 	Option 4: Do you go out to meet other people?	Pudding: Ive tried but someone like me doesnt get by that easily here. I was adopted by my grandparents and grew up here. 	Option 5: Im sorry about Vermont	Player: Im sorry if my partner scared you. She means no harm.	Pudding: ...
]
VERMONT:	Miss Pudding, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Vermont, terribly sorry if I spooked you earlier.

PUDDING:	Your the inspector from across the street.

VERMONT:	Huh?

PUDDING:	Ive seen you walking around talking to everyone. You spoke to Cyrus and she looked scared. I thought you were going to do something to them

VERMONT:	Oh, not at all. Apologies! [ Shes gotta sharp eye on things ]	So Im assuming you know why were here?

PUDDING:	Yes.But we must be quiet, the walls have ears.

VERMONT:	...

PUDDING:	Of course ma'am, one moment while I give you a hair cut.

VERMONT:	[playing along] Hope its not too much of a bother haha, its been a while since ive had a hair cut!

[Pudding turns on the blow dryer]
[Pudding leans into their ears]

PUDDING:	My livelihood is at stake speaking to you two. You have to promise me to not get me involved if anything else happens?

[Vermont clears their throat]

PUDDING:	Im not sure how useful this is, but I had a client come in recently looking suspiciously calm.

VERMONT:	Calm?

PUDDING:	I cant describe it beyond that but when he came in he 	requested a private pedicure.

VERMONT:	I see.
PUDDING:	Ive never seen him around town before so I thought he was a tourist. We dont get many of them around here so thought he was just nervous and needed something to calm himself. I took on the request and did his pedicure. He took off his shoes and it was covered in cement. 
VERMONT:	Cement?
PUDDING:	Im not sure if he was involved in a construction accident but Im assuming that was the reason he was so riled up about.
VERMONT:	Do you have a name?

PHARA:
Pudding! Hurry up with those two, weve got a few more clients coming in

PUDDING:	Yes, Ma'am. Follow me up front.

[The two dried off and went to the front desk to pay while pudding ran the register]

PUDDING:	That'll be $40.

[Pudding lifts a book onto the front desk and points at a name &quot;Orion&quot;]

VERMONT:	That was an excellent massage, ma'am. Have a good day.

PUDDING:	Thank you for stopping by.

[The player and Vermont left the spa]

VERMONT:	Orion... does that name sound familiar to you?

[Player: No]

VERMONT:	Alright, looks like were making some progress. We know that Kale stops by for coffee regularly here but what I'm more concerned is who this Orion is. 

[Player]:But where do we go from here...

VERMONT:	Well we cant just walk around town asking everyone about this &quot;Orion&quot; fellow.

CH6 FINAL

[Vermont and Player wake up with Diesel and Orion standing before them. Both locked onto a Pillory in the middle of the forest with little to no presence.]

Vermont
What the?! [Player} are you ok??
Orion, you parasite! What have you done with us?

Orion
Oh, why little ol me didn’t do a thing. It’s you who’s the true parasite, meddling in my business with your interruptions.

Vermont
Is this what you call a business? Meddling with these poor innocent townsfolk. And that coffee of yours…what did you do to them?

Orion
I’d watch that attitude of yours if I were you. Diesel..

[Vermont is punched by Diesel]

Vermont
AGH!

Orion
Interesting that you have the audacity to invade my new island with these assumptions.

[Orion lifts Vermont’s head with a knife by his neck]

Orion
But a little cutie like you, it’d be a shame for me to kill you right this second. Though, the wishbone society would be quite displeased if I left one alive.

Vermont
Wishbone? The fuck are you getting at?

Orion
You see, my dear Vermont. People like you…predators with your claws and sharp teeth, scare little ol folks like us. Prey constantly on the watch for people like you. There were too many of you and I just had to simple do some…damage control.

Vermont
You’re the one behind those missing people.

Orion
It’d be a lie if I said I wasn’t, but it was all for good reason detective don’t you worry.

Vermont
What good of a reason could possibly have had to murder all these townsfolks and get away with it. What did you eat them or something?

Orion
Oh, that would be simply barbaric, do I look like a man who would even think of eating you fiends. I had them buried of course.

Vermont
Liar! It’s that coffee… ever since you’ve shown up and that time, I drank it… Those beans came from YOU. What did you do to those innocent people?

Orion
Oh detective, I wish I could spoil the ending, but I think a smart detective like yourself could put two and two together.

Vermont
No…you didn’t.

Orion
The missing predators merely became fertilizer for my coffee beans. I find that natural decomposition of flesh is the perfect additive for my concoction.

Vermont
You… Why?! Why go through all this! Was the mayor one of your fertilizers?!

Orion
Pfft, that filthy ingrate.
No, it would have been too easy if rolled the dice with that man.

[Orion casually sits next to Vermont knife in hand]

Orion
You see, I have a dream… to make this island great!
When I got to this boring wasteland, I saw something missing, a direction. With this island slowly wasting away, these people needed something.

Vermont
Coffee??

Orion
A new leader. 
At first, I simply wanted a little coffee plant on this island, it’d provide the people here with new hope and opportunities. But that ingrate denied my request… NOONE SAYS NO TO ORION.
I had to make an example out of him.

Vermont
You killed the man for some dumb coffee.

Orion
Oh silly, is that what you think? Open your ears~
This town needed a direction, a new leader…me. I was hoping that the mayor would I accept my new construction plans but I had enough.
I Am Orion Von Revitora, billionaire extraordinaire… he was just a lowly frog who though low of me. So, I did what I could, the old man had a slight cough you see, and I offered him some medicine of my own device. A fiber pill.

Vermont
No… you didn’t!

Orion
The sucker swallowed it with some water and slowly passed before me.
Oh, you should have seen it detective, such a wonderful sight.
Seeing your enemies, learn their lesson.

Vermont
You bastard! He was an innocent man; they were all innocent! 

Orion
Tisk tisk… is someone getting a little riled up. 
I think it’s time for me to help you and your little partner here get some rest.

[Kale bursts from the bushes with Monty following suit]

Kale
You fucker! You’re the one who did it and after I trusted you!

Orion
Unhand me! Diesel get them!

[Diesel attempts to break Kale off Orion but Monty interrupts and start fighting]

Orion
You idiot, forget him and help ME. 
I’ll kill you and your who fucking family!

[Orion clearly losing the fight, retreats to town. Kale follows suit.]

Kale
Get back here!

Vermont
Kale! No get away from him!

[Monty helps the player and Vermont get out of the pillory. Kale and Orion make it to the town square. Kale blindly continues to throw punches at Orion while he submits.]

Orion
Stop! Please no!

[Kale in a blind rage grabs Orion and waterboards him in the fountain. While Orion was flailing, he grabs a fiber pill and swallows it, then swallows the water from the fountain]

[The towns folk watch in horror as Kale chokes Orion until his arm goes limp. Kale, recovering from her rage breathes heavily and takes a few steps back to see what they’ve done. Vermont, Player and Monty make it to town and sees the aftermath]

Townsfolk
Murderer! It was Kale all along! She murdered Orion! How could you! The mayor’s daughter!

Kale
I… I…

[Kale in shock looks at their hands as the police arrive and arrests them]

Chief
Kale Hoppins, you have been arrested and charged for homicide and the murder of Orion.

Kale
I’m sorry, I just…

[ Kale looks at Vermont as they are locked into the police car and slowly driven away]

Vermont
Kale… I…damn it

[The town disburse as the remaining officers slowly cover and dispose of Orion’s body.]

[A few months later in the penitentiary]

Officer 
Kale Hoppins, you bail has been covered. You free to leave.

Kale
What? Who?

[Vermont, Kale and Monty showed up]

Vermont
Hi Kale.

Kale
…Vermont 

[Kale rushes over to Vermont and gives her a hug]

Kale
I’m sorry, I knew I shouldn’t have… I just didn’t

[Vermont gives them a hug]

Vermont
Its ok, I know… you did what you could.

Kale (crying)
Mom never visited either…. 
I don’t think I can go back home, Vermont.

Vermont
… would you like to stay with me?

Kale
?!

Vermont
I have plenty of room at my home, your always welcome to-

Kale
Yes, thank you!

[Kale continues to hug Vermont as Player and Monty watch the two. A few weeks later, the four are tending to Vermont’s garden and Monty notices the sky getting darker than usual with paper started falling from the sky. Vermont hesitates and picks up one of the fliers. The flier, painted in blood read “The WishBone Society will return”. The four stares in horror of the new flier and worry about the future of the island.]

CHAPTER 1

[Case reading | Mayor’s office, City Hall: 11 PM]

It was a cold windy day as a storm was beginning to brew after a long week of summer head. A silhouette looms behind the mayor’s desk revealing a pale body of the once beloved mayor. That night, the curtains were left open allowing the passionate rain to soak the mayor on the spot. His body was discovered by his daughter Kale who has reached out to him to return for dinner. No evidence was found in the scene of the crime.

[Scene reveals to be the police station]

CHIEF
What kind of bastard would do such a thing. 
And here I thought this town was finally getting peaceful. 
Ma’am, do you remember anything else that night?

MADAM HOPPIN
Not that I know of my daughter was the one who…found him. 
I’m sure she can provide more details but, right now… we’d like to be left alone for the time being. Im sure you understand, cheif.

CHIEF
Yes, of course. I understand.

[The chief packs up and heads out to of the room to investigate the area further bu twas stopped by Madam Hoppin. ]

MADAM HOPPIN
Chief.

CHIEF
Yes, Madam?

MADAM HOPPIN
I want you to find whoever did this and bring them to me by any means necessary. They have disrupted the balance of not only this town but the lives of this family. My husband was a peaceful man who was selfless and cared for this town for years…Stop at nothing until the monster who did this gets the punishment they deserve.

CHIEF
Understood.

[Chief leaves city hall to return to the police station]

CHIEF
…Unbelievable. Were already piled on with missing cases and now the mayor... Things are getting out of hand.

[The chief looks at the piles of papers stacked on their desks looking defeated]

[Player Options #1] 

CHIEF
?!
Oh you, I didn’t see you there. 
Sorry, my memory is still a bit fuzzy…what was your name again?

[Player inserts name]

CHIEF
Ah yes, [player]. Your new here, aren’t you? 
You’ve come at the right time detective. I’m sure you’ve already heard of what happened in city hall… The entire station is backed up and we could you as much help as we can get.

[Player Options #2] 

Chief [ If options 1 or 2]

CHIEF [IF OPTION 3]:	?! I will not tolerate such disrespect in my office. The force has been working hard to ensure that the townsfolk feel safe for generations to come. And I won’t allow some spoiled, asshole from the city poison this town’s safety with your attitude.

CHIEF [AFTERWARDS]:	Anyway, your still new here so I can’t just trust a new detective from the academy for such a hefty case. Here take this, I need you to go to this address and look for this person. They just got off retirement but the best person for this job. I need you to track them down and make them take the case. With all the distractions we have at the station, we need a seasoned point of view to solve this case. Will you, do it?

[IF PLAYER AGREES]

CHIEF
Perfect, knew I can count on you! Good luck and don’t let me down. 

[ Case File received.]

Panel 1: Vermont's Garden

[Pans to the street sign with address in case] 

[ It was bright, clear sky on this wonderful Saturday morning. Lush fruitful trees, colorful flowers dancing in the wind, not a worry in sight on this beautiful day. ]

[PLAYER]
This must be the place.

[ The player walks up to a beautiful garden with trees and flowers of many a variety. Curious they stop to smell the flowers and appreciate the scenery. ]

??:	
Enjoying the Magnolias?
                 
[PLAYER]
?!

[A tall elderly badger appeared behind you. They’re wearing a flowery apron and wreak of roses.]

??
Those are magnolias, one of my prized flowers. 
They were a gift from an old friend.

[PLAYER]
They are gorgeous, I don’t think I’ve seen these types of flowers on the island.

??
Excellent observation, they are native on another island not too far from here, but I do appreciate the compliment, [ Player].

[PLAYER]
How did you???

??
	It’s a small town. Its not hard to know who is who around here. 
Oh, mind my manners, I’m Vermont the owner of this garden.

[PLAYER]
I’m Detective [Player].

VERMONT
Pleasure to meet you detective [Player]. What brings you here?

[PLAYER]
I’m here under order from chief to deliver this to this address. 

[Vermont receives the case papers]

VERMONT
…	
Would you like some lemonade? Walking here must have been exhausting and I could use a glass myself.

[PLAYER]
I’m sorry, madam but my orders were to give this to you.
 I should return to the station

VERMONT
I insist please come in

[Player enters Vermont’s living room]

[The room has a strong tropical appearance with lots of potted plants and a wood stove. Its small yet cozy. Vermont sits with you with a glass of lemonade.]

[PLAYER]
I appreciate the hospitality but…

VERMONT
You need help with the mayor’s murder case?

[PLAYER]
The chief doesn’t trust me with a case this big, so they’re requesting help from you it seems.

VERMONT
I see, I’m sorry but I can’t take the case. I’m retired and have been out of the field for years. I came to this town to finally find some peace. Please tell your Chief that I respectfully decline. This is none of my business and I don’t want anymore stress in my life.

[PLAYER]
Please ma’am. This isn’t just a regular case; the livelihood of the whole town is at stake. 

[The player and Vermont are interrupted by MADAM HOPPIN who appears with several bodyguards standing right by the room door]

MADAM HOPPIN
I’m afraid the young detective is correct.

BOTH VERMONT AND PLAYER
	?!

MADAM HOPPIN
The townsfolk are feeling restless after the assassination of my husband. 
And I fear things are getting worse.

[MADAM HOPPIN gives more reports of missing people in town]
                 
MADAM HOPPIN
People are going Missing Vermont and the police…they wont disclose this to the public but even they are fearful of their own lives to do anything about it. 

VERMONT
This has nothing to do with me.

MADAM HOPPIN
That may be so, but this isn’t just a regular late night bar quarrel. This is real, Vermont. If the police won’t do anything, I can only trust a true professional to handle this case. You came to this town to finally have your freedom and I respect that but please, please help us Inspector Vermont.

[ Vermont reflects on the decision and looks at MADAM HOPPIN who reminds her of her ex-wife and stands up]

VERMONT
MADAM HOPPIN. I humbly accept your case. Ill do whatever I get to the bottom of it.

MADAM HOPPIN
Thank you…Thank you Inspector...

[Player looks on and was stopped by Vermont]

VERMONT
[Player] would you like to join me on this case? Ill need the help of familiar face if we are to get to the bottom of this.

[Player hesitates but agrees]

[ Vermont dawns their coat and join the player as they return to city hall to begin their investigation]

CHAPTER 1 END 

                                                                                                    

CHAPTER 2

[City Hall in the Mayor’s room. Scene of the crime, player and Vermont are in the mayor’s office. The three are standing over an outline of where Hoppins was found with other officers in the background.]

VERMONT
…I’m sorry things had to end this way, Hoppin… 
Madam, was there anyone else here at the scene of the crime?

MADAM HOPPIN
My daughter Kale was the one who found him here. I’m sure she could help with that.

KALE
…
                 
VERMONT
Hello there, I’m Inspector Vermont. You must be Kale, it’s a pleasure to meet you.

KALE
…
                 
MADAM HOPPIN
Its okay dear, they’re only here to help. Would you like to speak to the detectives? Or would you like to go outside?

KALE
	I’m ok with talking to them. I want to help with this case too.

MADAM HOPPIN
Thank you dear, if you ever get uncomfortable just let me know.

[ OPTIONS: Mayor Hoppins | Did you see anyone?]
                 
KALE [1]:
You mean my dad? That night, it was getting close to midnight so my mom told me to get my dad so we can all eat at the dinner table. When I got there the room was dark and the windows were open so there were puddles of water all over the floor. I figured dad must’ve fallen asleep at his desk again, so I went to close the windows and wake him up…I tried nudging him to wake him up, but he didn’t move. His body flipped to the side, and he was limp without a sign of life in his eyes. I rushed to mom and that was all I saw.

KALE [2]
When I went to check on him, I didn’t notice anyone there at the time. All I remember was seeing him…lying there.

VERMONT
I’m so sorry to hear that.

KALE
	I have to go…

[Kale leaves the room]

MADAM HOPPIN
She’s going through a lot right now, please forgive her

VERMONT
Its not a problem Ms. Hoppins. I’m sure this must’ve been a lot to take in on a regular night. [Player] and I will inspect the area for clues.

MADAM HOPPIN
Of course, I shall leave it to you both

[MADAM HOPPIN leaves the office for the two to inspect the area]

[OPTIONS: Window | Door | Desk | Bookshelves | Floor]

[If floor is chosen]

VERMONT
What’s this? Coffee grinds? 
Must’ve come from the mayor’s coffee mug. (They smell them) 
These are still fresh, and I don’t see any signs of a coffee maker in here. Not sure how useful this will be but let’s hang on to this. 

[PLAYER RECEIVES NEW EVIDENCE] 

VERMONT
I think that should be everything, lets see if we can find anyone else to speak to about this incident.

[Player gets option to go outside if needed]

Panel 1: The Drive through

VERMONT
Huh…No ones here. Well since were already outside lets see if we can find anything out of place. The mayor’s office is just above here so the culprit must have jumped through the window and landed here.

[Player has option to scout the area. If side walk is chosen:]

VERMONT
Did you find something?
?!	
A foot print? And it looks like it got engraved in the cement

??
Hey you there! You cant be here.

VERMONT
Apologies, who might you be?

DIESEL
Diesel, a contractor, I work here. And you are?

VERMONT
Im Inspector Vermont and this is my partner [Player]	Were here to…

DIESEL
Im gonna have to stop you right there. I heard about the mayor and the whole kerfuffle but your stepping on wet cement there bud.

[Vermont scrambles to get out and wipe their hooves]

DIESEL
No one reads the signs these days. Its bad enough I have to lay a fresh coat after some idiot messed up the last one.

VERMONT
You mean the footprint?

DIESEL
Yeah, see. The sidewalk needs a bit of polishin’. People have been complaining nowadays so I was hired to rework the thing.

[Player Options: Where were you | Who do you work for?]

DIESEL
[If asked: Who do you work for?]	
Listen pal, enough with the questions. Im just here to grab my coffee, lay out cement and go home. Don’t want any part of this mayor thing

VERMONT
I understand. Could we perhaps keep this piece here?

DIESEL
Do whatever you want, just get out of here.

[Player receives footprint and gets kicked out to the city street]

VERMONT
Well that was pleasant. I know Im new here but Ive never seen there face before.	At least we retrieved more evidence, we couldn’t find anything else on the scene….

[Player has a chance to look through evidence]

VERMONT
All we have are a few coffee beans and a footprint. 
Given from the looks of it the culprit must have been an avian of some kind. 

[Player: Lets stop at the café]

VERMONT
Your right, no sense standing here thinking.

Panel 1: Wild Roost Cafe

[The player and Vermont enter the café and gets started by a loud squawk]

??
Number 94, Caramel Latter extra cream hold the sugar!

VERMONT
Wow, wasn’t what I was prepared for.

[A chatty barista is spotted behind the register]

CYRUS
There you go Ma’am, thank you for coming to the Wild Roost, enjoy your day! Next in line!

VERMONT
Hi, Can I have a Large Green tea, no sugar please. What would you like [Player]
                 
[Player] will have [ Choice]

CYRUS
Sure thing, would you like this for here or to-go?

VERMONT
Here please

CYRUS
Here's your number, we’ll deliver your order to your seat when ready!

VERMONT
Thank you

[Player and Vermont sit at table with their table number erect on the table]

VERMONT
Not a fan of coming to this place, it smells weird.

[Player: Smells fine to me. | Is it the coffee | That’s weird]

VERMONT
Ive been here before since I moved.
For some reason the coffee just wreaks… Ive had coffee else where but this café is just, not for me	Although that barista… noticed anything weird about them [Player]

[Player mentions their feet]

VERMONT
Precisely, theyre an avian with an similar footprint to the evidence we retrieved at Town Hall. We should speak to them

[Player: We should leave them alone | Invite them to the table | Just enjoy your drink]

CYRUS
There you go, one green tea and a [Drink choice]

VERMONT
This is a stunning design, sir, did you make this?

CYRUS
Oh thank you I did, Ive been working on my technique since I started working here *squawk*

VERMONT
Please, do take a seat with us. We’d love to learn more.

[Cyrus hesitates]

CYRUS
I should probably get back, theres probably a few customers waiting in line.

VERMONT
It seems its just us. I insist.

[Cyrus squawks then take a seat]
[Vermont sips theyre drink.]

VERMONT
A fine brew sir. I usually make my own tea at home but this is well done. Is this a popular drink here?

CYRUS
Thank you and yeah it is, we usually have a bunch of customers coming in for it. But our most popular drink is our expresso

VERMONT
People really love their coffee here

[Cyrus squawk in excitement]

CYRUS
Would you blame them, its so popular even Kale stops by for her morning brew.
Havent seen her in a while though, hope she’s okay. Probably meditating in the forest again.

VERMONT
You know Kale?

CYRUS
Yeah, she’s a regular here! 	We chat every now and then, she usually stops by after visiting the salon across the street. 

VERMONT
You watched her cross the street?

CYRUS
Well yeah, it is a glass window. Usually see people pass by all the time, some even stop by to get a drink.

VERMONT
Strange that people get so excited over just some coffee.

CYRUS
Its not JUST any coffee this is an exotic imported coffee from off the island!	Beans grown here are too sweet. Folks really love the new imported brand because its just the right blend of sweet and bitter. [ ] Coffee is one of a kind and were honestly having a hard time keeping our shelves stocked haha

[Vermont taps at Player to look down at Cyrus’s feet and take a picture.]

[Picture acquired]

VERMONT
Do you know where its from?

CYRUS
Unfortunately, I only know its imported. Though I heard a new coffee plant is being built just off the outskirts of town. Its been pretty empty so Im glad something new is happening around here.

MANAGER
Cyrus, we've got customers coming in!

CYRUS
That’s my queue. It was nice talking to you all. Enjoy your drink

[Cyrus leaves the table.]

[Player: Why did you make me take a picture of their feet?]

VERMONT
While they are avian, I didn’t want to scare them off by mentioning the murder and showing evidence. 	Dont look at me like that! Its clearly needed for our investigation!	Plus, she’s a civilian. We shouldn’t be running around causing mass panic just because were looking for a murderer. The best thing we can do is to keep the peace as best as we can. 
                 
                 
[Player shows pictures side by side]

VERMONT
The toes on the engraving is vastly different from that young barista. The nails on the print were well trimmed too. While the hunch about the suspect being avian may be leading us in an interesting direction. Were not making much progress…	The barista had mentioned that Kale stops by here after their spa. Kind of grasping at straws here but I think our next best bet is to check it out. 

CH 2 END
                                                                                                    


CH 3

[Vermont and their assistant make their way to the salon just a few blocks from the cafe. There they are greeted with melodious chimes from the door and met the receptionist]

VERMONT
Hi, Inspector Vermont with the local Police. Id like to speak with you regarding intel on a regular at your salon.

PHARA
Oh no no no no. Not here.
I'm tired of your police folk coming in here interrupting my business.

VERMONT
This town's really friendly... Im sorry ma'am, we'll be out of your way shortly, we just need to speak to someone for a moment.

PHARA
If ya aint here for business then I suggest you leave.

VERMONT
Oh dear... we need to speak to a few people in the area but the receptionist isnt the friendliest. How do we do this?

[ Player Options]

VERMONT
Good idea! Ma'am, would it be possible to have a quick pedicure while were here. My colleague and I have been walking quite a bit and it would be nice to treat ourselves even for just a few minutes.

PHARA
Hmm... I dont trust ya but my shop needs the customers...Fine. Sit over there and Ill have Puddin' take care of yah. 

[ Vermont and player are escorted to their chairs to get their pedicure]

PUDDING
Welcome.

VERMONT
Oh hello there!

PUDDING
Pedicure for two? Feet in the tray please. 

VERMONT
You must be pudding its a pleasure to meet you.

PUDDING
...

VERMONT
I take it that im not welcomed here. [Player] could you help me out with this situation?	We need as much intel as possible and I take it that they trust you more.

[PLAYER SECTION:
(Option 1: Pleasure to meet you Pudding!
Pudding
Hello
Option 2: How long have you worked here?	Pudding: Ive worked here all my life. I care for big people.	Player: Big People?	Pudding: Large folk with claws and sharp teeth.	Vermont: Ah, strange that she describes people like that...	Option 3: What do you do outside of work?	Pudding: I...don't really go anywhere. This job is all Im good 		at. 	Option 4: Do you go out to meet other people?	Pudding: Ive tried but someone like me doesnt get by that easily here. I was adopted by my grandparents and grew up here. 	Option 5: Im sorry about Vermont	Player: Im sorry if my partner scared you. She means no harm.	Pudding: ...]

VERMONT
Miss Pudding, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Vermont, terribly sorry if I spooked you earlier.

PUDDING
Your the inspector from across the street.

VERMONT
Huh?

PUDDING
Ive seen you walking around talking to everyone. You spoke to Cyrus and she looked scared. I thought you were going to do something to them

VERMONT
Oh, not at all. Apologies! [ Shes gotta sharp eye on things ]	So Im assuming you know why were here?

PUDDING
Yes.But we must be quiet, the walls have ears.

VERMONT
...

PUDDING
Of course ma'am, one moment while I give you a hair cut.

VERMONT
[playing along] Hope its not too much of a bother haha, its been a while since ive had a hair cut!

[Pudding turns on the blow dryer]
[Pudding leans into their ears]

PUDDING
My livelihood is at stake speaking to you two. You have to promise me to not get me involved if anything else happens?

[Vermont clears their throat]

PUDDING
Im not sure how useful this is, but I had a client come in recently looking suspiciously calm.

VERMONT
Calm?

PUDDING
I cant describe it beyond that but when he came in he requested a private pedicure.

VERMONT
I see.

PUDDING
Ive never seen him around town before so I thought he was a tourist. We dont get many of them around here so thought he was just nervous and needed something to calm himself. I took on the request and did his pedicure. He took off his shoes and it was covered in cement. 

VERMONT
Cement?

PUDDING
Im not sure if he was involved in a construction accident but Im assuming that was the reason he was so riled up about.

VERMONT
Do you have a name?

PHARA
Pudding! Hurry up with those two, weve got a few more clients coming in

PUDDING
Yes, Ma'am. Follow me up front.

[The two dried off and went to the front desk to pay while pudding ran the register]

PUDDING
That'll be $40.

[Pudding lifts a book onto the front desk and points at a name &quot;Orion&quot;]

VERMONT
That was an excellent massage, ma'am. Have a good day.

PUDDING
Thank you for stopping by.

[The player and Vermont left the spa]

VERMONT
Orion... does that name sound familiar to you?

[Player: No]

VERMONT
Alright, looks like were making some progress. We know that Kale stops by for coffee regularly here but what I'm more concerned is who this Orion is. 

[Player]
But where do we go from here...

VERMONT
Well we cant just walk around town asking everyone about this &quot;Orion&quot; fellow.

Chapter 4

Vermont
Kale is mostly likely with their mother so its best we head back to town hall to gather more information

The Player and Vermont return to the Town hall and meets Madam Hoppins

Madam Hoppins
Welcome back inspectors
Did you manage to find anything?

Vermont
We managed to get more Intel from the towns folk but we just have a few details we’d like to confirm if you don't mind.

Madam Hoppins
Of Course, Id like to help however I can

Vermont
Thats very thoughtful of you ma'am

[Player Options]
- Orion, Kale, Mayor

If Orion is chosen

Madam Hoppins
My dear, we cant reveal details regarding our towns folk. The people who reside here come to escape from their previous lives and start a fresh slate. As much as I have trusted you with this investigation, I just cant offer you details of that nature.

Vermont
I understand.
Could you possibly give us any details on what he does here?

Madam Hoppins
He’s owns the Big Beak estate just south of town near the pier. He’s helped many residents find homes so his services have greatly helped our small town.

Vermont
I'm sure he has.
Thank you so much Madam, we will be on our way

Madam Hoppins
Take care.

[The investigator and Player go to the parking lot outside]

Vermont
Something about her feels off to me. 
Very quick to defend the townsfolk once we have mentioned Orion. Its just a hunch but I think theres more to this man than it seems based on Pudding’s findings.

[ Vermont and player hears clanging and noises in the background. A wild Kale appears]

Kale
Hey, hows it going fellas

Vermont
Kale?!

Kale
What? Oh, yeah thats me.

Vermont
Are you OK?

Kale
Fine fine, just had a quick run and now I am back in action Woo!

Vermont
[Player- I think he’s intoxicated in some way and wreaks of coffee. This might be our chance to get some Intel]
I'm glad!

Kale
So what're you guys doing here?! Chatting with my mom

Vermont
Um, yes, we spoke to her earlier about a few matters.
Kale do you by any chance know Orion?

Kale
Pssh, course I know him. Used to run a few errands for the guy.

Vermont
Errands?

Kale
Yeah, being the kid of the towns politicians gets a little boring.
So I go out and take odd jobs here and there.

Vermont
What kind of jobs did you do for Orion.

Kale
The dude pays well so I just do whatever he asks. Cleaning, lawn work, you know the usual.

Vermont
So he just hires you to do some cleaning.

Kale
Those are the only job I take from him.
My mom hates the guy, thinks he’s real shady so I try to keep my distance.

Vermont
Shady? Has he done anything weird to you

Kale
Well.
Nothing to me, but the way he acts makes me feel as if, its just a mask he’s hiding behind. And Id rather not joke around with him and find out whats underneath it.

Vermont
Hm, seems like the people here are afraid of this Orion fellow.

Vermont
How long has he lived here.

Kale
Oh he just got here a few months back. 
Got real chumming with the people here and now he’s got his own little fan club. Its kind of weird now that you mention it.

Vermont
I see. Do you know where he is right now?

Kale
Probably at his estates down the street. Hes a big fluffy guy, cant miss him.

Vermont
Thank you, Kale

Kale
No biggie. 
Also uh, don't tell mom what I told you guys…
I don't usually get much freedom and things have gotten pretty rocky since dad..you know.

Vermont
Your secrets safe with us.

Kale
Thank you.

[ The two arrive near the condo and spot two shadowy figures facing each other]

Cyrus
I'm sorry sir, I'm late again this month. I promise Ill pay you back

???Oh, don't worry son. I'm just glad that your doing well these days. 
Hows Paige and the cafe.

Cyrus
Shes doing great and the coffee you gave us is doing wonder for sales recently.
People just cant stop drinking the stuff its insane, like…
What your secret ingredient man??

???
Haha, thats something you’d have to figure out on your own.
What good is a businessman if he gives away all his secrets.

Cyrus
Thats true, I'm sorry Mr. Orion

Orion
No need. Its getting dark now, how about we head in and discuss all this another time.

Cyrus
Sure, well, have a good night sir!

Orion 
You too!

[ Cyrus leaves the scene ]

Orion
I see you’ve decided to stop by for a visit, Vermont, [Player]

Player and Vermont
?!

Vermont
I didn't think we were invited.

Orion
Nonsense, everyone is welcome here.
I take it you aren't here for a special tour aren't you detective

Vermont
You seem to know who we are before we even got the chance to introduce ourselves.

Orion
With the ehem recent incident with our beloved mayor. Word tends to go around pretty quickly, especially about a certain detective and their partner roaming about.

Vermont
…
I'm guessing we aren't as welcomed as you made out to be.

Orion
I wouldn't say that.
You just happened to be in the neighborhood and…well
For the sake of my tenants, I'm going to ask you kindly to leave the premises.

Vermont
?!
But we have said anything?

Orion
I think your presence has done enough. 
If your don't Ill have no choice but to use force.

Vermont
I can assure you theres no need for that.
We would just like to request an offer of your time.

Orion
And I'm afraid Id have to offer you to leave.

??
Whats going on here?

Vermont and Player
??

Vermont
What the who?!

[ Orion disappears behind the blinding light ]

Vermont
We mean no harm, were just here to meet Orion her-

[Vermont notices that Orion flees the scene but the wet pavement is there]

???
…No one else is here but the two of you

Vermont
It seems our conversation got cut short. We will be on our way now

???
Upupup, not so fast. Your coming with me.
Cant let two wanders go under Neighborhood watch’s patrol.

[ The two are escorted to the pier with the neighborhood watch patrol officer]

???
Ive been seeing you two wandering around lately.

Vermont
Forgive the rudeness but I believe we are owed an introduction of some kind.
We were meeting with the Mr Orion and now got dragged to the other side of town.

Monty
Alright, just to make things easier. 
My name is Monty, I run the pier near the coast of town and part of the neighborhood watch. I scout the are and try my best to keep the folks here safe.

Vermont
How many people are in this neighborhood watch of yours

Monty
Oh its just me for the time being. Not many people are eager to walk around at night for creeps. Especially with all the…recent incidents.

Vermont
I take it you speak of the incident with the mayor

Monty
Have you been living under a rock or something?
Yes, the mayor’s case is the biggest one yet but… folks around here have gone missing too. And I hate to say it but a few folks may be suspecting that the two of you may be involved.

Vermont
We are investigators tasked by Madam Hoppins to investigate the case of her late husband. Why in the world would we do such a thing.

Monty
Well its not you and your partner folks are worried a bout. 
Its just you, tall badger wandering around town does draw suspicion.

Vermont
Ive lived here for a few month, I would never hurt anyone.

Monty
I get that, but with a small town its easy for folks to recognize newcomers and locals.

Vermont
Are you saying that I may have something to do with the missing cases.

Monty
Don't get me wrong officer, I'm not one to judge but picture this.
If you were living in a small town of lets say 5-10 folks and someone new stops by, people would immediately know that your not from around here. 
Now lets say that missing people started to disappear one after the other during the time when this new comer is conveniently not in town.

Vermont
With all due respect, I'm here to retire peacefully.
I have no intentions to harm anyone on this island and that fact that people are accusing me of such thing is insulting.

Monty
Your being insulted by rumors then
Just as how you are offended by these accusations, nothing is confirmed. 
But I take it, if the mayor’s wife tasked you to investigate the mayor’s murder then I assume theres more to meet the eyes.

Vermont
…
This all feels like an interrogation. 
How can someone in the neighbor hood watch know so much about these sort of thing anyway. 

Monty
Your not the only one who’s not from here who came for a peaceful life inspector.

Vermont
…

Monty
Ive seen my fair share of misjudgment in my life.
An old soul like me gets tired of it after a while.

Vermont
I take it your from off the island as well?

Monty
Yup, used to be a professional wrestler back in the good old days.
Things got a little rough so came here not too long ago.

Vermont
What happened?

Monty
Sigh.. 40 years ago I was the national champion in my league.
Traveled far and wide to every tournament in the world and always made it to the top. 
“Mad Dog Monty” is what they used to call me.

Vermont
Mad Dog huh, back in the field they used to call me “Vermont the Vacant”

Monty
Vacant?

Vermont
Yeah, I used to work in private investigations for 40 years. Always found the killer no matter what. I was told that with every case Id give a blank look. As if I'm a predator stalking their prey or something.

Monty
He-he, I know that feeling.
People in the ring always got that look from me. Scare the crap out of them but I didn't mind all too much. 
So uh, if things were so good what made you come all the way out here?

Vermont
…
Despite the nick name, things didn't feel right. 
You can only get reports of innocent people getting hurt for so long. All the trials, the phone calls, the testimonies… it eats away at your sanity one by one.
At first I joined the force to help the community, but at the cost I lost everything… my sanity, my will to live. Only after losing my late wife that I had to retire and leave the town I valiantly served.

Monty
Sound rough, I'm uh, sorry that happened to you.

Vermont
Its nothing to apologize for, if anything im sorry you had to hear this old soul ramble about the past.

Monty
I wouldn't say that.
Went through kind of the same thing as well.
A few years ago, I decided one last match before the road, things were changing about me that I didn't like. On my final match, things were heating up as usual, one more punch and the belt is mine but…something took over that day.
I felt a rush. Things went dark and before I knew it my opponent was down on the ground with a gaping bit would…from me.

Vermont
You bit him?

Monty
I didn't mean to!
I don't know what happened but since that day I ran. Ran as far as I could.
What happened, why did I bite him. 
I was scare but most of all I was scared of myself.
I him away from the public and word got around that I murdered the guy.

Vermont
If you felt so guilty why didn't you turn yourself in.

Monty
You know from a cop’s point of view, it'd be that easy but… look at me.
People like me don't get a slap on the wrist for an accidental bite. 
They were gonna kill me.

Vermont
Oh.

Monty
I knew that if I stayed where I was that if they ever caught me, Id never see the light of day. I didn't wanna leave, that was my home…

Vermont
What did you do?

Monty
…
I paid an old friend a visit at the hospital. The guy I bit.
Luckily he was recovering well and forgave me, but even with that I couldn't forgive myself. I loved wrestling but Id never hurt a fly outside the ring.
Once I said my goodbyes, I headed to the shore and swam…swam as far away as possible. 
Washed up on this right here island and Mayor Hoppins took me in.
Folks were afraid of me but eventually warmed up to me. 
Hoppins wanted me to be his official bodyguard but I couldn't risk it, not like what happened last time. So I offered to run this here pier and run neighborhood watch and here we are.

Vermont
You've been through quite a lot Monty.

Monty
Yeah, you got me crying over here in front of a bunch of people I don't even know.

Vermont
I understand though Monty.
You don't want anyone to be harmed in anyway, even if it meant isolating yourself. 
Believing that the only way to keep a peaceful life is to isolate yourself as much as possible until your final breathe…
But theres definitely more out there for you. 
The town might be small but we've met some great people who care about this town just as much as you do…and if you ever need a friend, I'm here for you.
I know what its like to be treated differently and…as hard as things might be…it gets better, I promise

Monty 
You know, for a cop. Your not so bad yourself

Vermont
When you've been in the field this long, you've seen a lot.
But what hurts the most is seeing your fellow officers treat the people they protect like dust.
I solemnly promise that my partner and I haven't he towns best interest at heart and would never hurt anyone. However, this final case is big.

Monty
I know. 

Vermont
We cant allow things to keep going like this and for more and more people we care about to get hurt.
I was tasked by Madam to find the culprit and end this. Apologies if I seemed suspicious speaking to Mr Orion but that fellow just feels off.

Monty
I thought I was the only one who thought that.

Vermont
You too?!

Monty
He’s new around here. A rich tycoon who drifted a little off shore and discovers the island. He funded a few living spaces for the town and people love him.

Vermont
Ive heard.

Monty
But think about it, a billionaire just conveniently wanders into town and now he’s got a whole fan club.

Vermont
Do you think he’s up to something.

Monty
No doubt it, Ive met my fair share of rich folk back in my career and if theres one thing Ive learned is that no ones truly satisfied with what they have. People like that always crave more.

Vermont
Why didn't you report him to the police.

Monty
Vermont, do you hear yourself.
People look at me and would think In the killer over here. 
A man of that much power isn't a person you can just report to the police and get away scot free.

Vermont
Your right. What we need is hard evidence that this Orion fellow is up to something. 
But no matter what we try, we cant seem to get any concrete evidence besides rumors.

Monty
I know I said I wouldn't be involved. But Ive noticed something weird on my usual patrols. Ive seen folks wander around the woods holding sacks of some kind.

Vermont
Sacks? Could you describe the person you saw holding it.

Monty
Sharks don't have good eye sight but that bag, wreaked of meat and roses. 

Vermont
Roses… The receptionist, Phara?!
[Player] we need to leave now

Monty
Where are you going?

Vermont
Thank you so much Monty but we need to leave now.
Oh and if you ever need a friend to chat with I live just north from here. Stop by for some tea sometime!

Monty
He-he, will do.

[ Vermont and Player rush off to the salon now that the newest suspect has been reveled ]
CH 4 END 

                                                                                                    
CH5

[Vermont and player rush into the salon]

Vermont
Hello, is anyone here?

Pudding
Detective? Your back, whats wrong?

Vermont
Nothing of concern but I need to speak to your manager.

Pudding
Phara? She just left, its closing hour so she left me to clean up shop.

Vermont
Do you know when she’ll be back.

Pudding
I dont know. She always leaves early and she’s not the type to share her personal business.

Vermont
I see, mind if we wait around while incase she comes back?

Pudding
Of course!

[Player and vermont wait out at the front of teh salon]

Vermont
I think were starting to get the big picture here [Player]
Just as Monty mentioned, we have a prime suspect in the wait but we cant just barge in and make accusations. We have to figure out how to expose this man for who he truly is and fast.

[Vermont picks up on the smell again and sees a shadowy figure in the distance]

Vermont
Over there!

[Player and Vermont pick up on the scent and book it towards the pier]

Vermont
Wait, stop!

[ The figure dives into the water and Vermont follows suit. The figure then grabs Vermont’s leg and pulls him down. Unable to breathe Vermont struggles to swim up to the surface and is then rescued by Monty]

Monty
The hell are you doing out here!

Vermont
Cough cough. I was close

Monty
Are you nuts?! You cant swim, you couldve drowned.

Vermont
Monty, I saw them!

MontyWhat?

Vermont
The person who smelled of meat and roses.
We chased them all the way to the pier and they jumped into the ocean…did you see them?

Monty
Sorry, detective. I was in the shack I didnt even see anyone jump in.

Vermont
DAMN. And we were so close too.

Monty
Perhaps you should rest a bit.

Vermont
NO. 
This case has gone on long enough, dont you see.
Liek you said, people are going missing, that crazy chicken threatened to kill me and I nearly drowned. 

Monty
Listen.
I know this is tough but you gotta keep it together man. 
Ill help however way I can, you have me and player to help as well.
What did you both see.

Vermont
I saw a figure with a long tail jumping in with a sack.

Monty
The water…that mustve been the reason Ive been the only one who’s noticed that weird smell. Whomever did this knew what they were doing and had the experience behind it.

Vermont
There was a trail that they left while we chased them…

Monty
Alright, lets follwo the trail and see where it leads.

Vermont
Your coming with us?

Monty
Your gonna need all the help you can get.

[The three follow the trail that leads to near the cafe]

Vermont
Stay here Monty, Player and I have a few questions we need to ask.

[Vermont enters the cafe]

Cyrus
Vermont, its good to see you again!

Vermont
Wonderful to see you as well Cyrus, hows everything.

Cyrus
Nothing out of the usual, just the same old.

Vermont
I saw you just the other day with Orion.

Cyrus
Oh him? Yeah we were just chating about the usual business. A friend of his stopped by with another sack of those special coffee beans.

Vermont
Aside from said friend do you know where he got these beans.

Cyrus
Theyre imported from what im told but between you and me.
Mr Orion said that since business has been booming with these new beans that he’s planning on building a coffee plant for the town!

Vermont
A coffee plant!

Cyrus
Yeah! And he said he’ll make me the manager of it once its ready!
Isnt that exciting!

Vermont
Interesting, so Orion is the one behind these beans.

Cyrus
Thats right!
Care for a sample?!

Vermont
You know what, maybe I will. Thank you

[Vermont takes a cup and leaves the shop]

Vermont
…

[Vermont takes a sip of the coffee]

Vermont
Cough cough, ahahahaha!! This is great, woo!

Monty
You alright?

Vermont
Never felt so good! Monty want me to do anything for you buddy?!
Ill do anything anything!

Monty
The matter with you???

[Player splashes them with water]

Vermont
What what happened?

Monty
You drank that sample and went full on crazy.
As if you were addicted to teh stuff. Have you had coffee before?

Vermont
Im not the biggest fan of it but… if what you said is true then…
Were going to Orion.

Monty
What?

Vermont
We never got the chance to properly speak to him… Monty, I wont make you come along if you arent comfortable. 

Monty
Ill follow the trail from earlier, you can go on ahead. 

Vermont
Alright. [Player] this is our last shot. I dont know who this man is… but if what Kale said is true, we MUST be on our toes. He’s the only one in town we havent spoken with… its all or nothing.

[Vermont storms off with Player back to the condominiums]

Vermont
Were here but where the hell could he be…

[Vermont rings the doorbell then a shadowy figure knocks them both out]

CH5 END
                                                                                                     

CH6 FINAL

[Vermont and Player wake up with Diesel and Orion standing before them. Both locked onto a Pillory in the middle of the forest with little to no presence.]

Vermont
What the?! [Player} are you ok??
Orion, you parasite! What have you done with us.

Orion
Oh, why little ol me didnt do a thing. Its you who’s the true parasite, meddling in my business with your interruptions.

Vermont
Is this what you call a business? Meddling with these poor innocent townsfolk. And that coffee of yours…what did you do to them?

Orion
Id watch that attitude of yours if I were you.Diesel..

[Vermont is punched by Diesel]

Vermont
AGH!

Orion
Interesting that you have the audacity to invade my new island with these assumptions.

[Orion lifts Vermonts head with a knife by his neck]

Orion
But a little cutie like you, itd be a shame for me to kill you right this second. Though, the wishbone society would be quite displeased if I left one alive..

Vermont
Wishbone? The fuck are you getting at?

Orion
You see, my dear Vermont. People like you…predators with your claws and sharp teeth, scare little ol folks like us. Prey constantly on the watch for people like you. There were too many of you and I just had to simple do some…damage control.

Vermont
Your the one behind those missing people.

Orion
Itd be a lie if I said I wasnt but it was all for good reason detective dont you worry.

Vermont
What good of a reason could possibly have had to murder all these townsfolks and get away with it. What did you eat them or something.

Orion
Oh that would be simply barbaric, do I look like a man who would even think of eating you fiends. I had them buried of course.

Vermont
Liar! Its that coffee… ever since youve shown up and that time I drank it… Those beans came from YOU. What did you do to those innocent people.

Orion
Oh detective, I wish I could spoil the ending but I think a smart detective like yourself could put two and two together.

Vermont
No…you didnt.

Orion
The missing predators merely became fertilizer for my coffee beans. I find that natural decomposition of flesh is the perfect additive for my concoction.

Vermont
You… Why?! Why go through all this! Was the mayor one of your fertilizers?!

Orion
Pfft, that filty ingrate.
No it would have been too easy if rolled the dice with that man.

[Orion casually sits next to Vermont knife in hand]

Orion
You see, I have a dream… to make this island great!
When I got to this boring wasteland, I saw something missing, a direction. With this island slowly wasting away, these people needed something.

Vermont
Coffee??

Orion
A new leader. 
At first I simply wanted a little coffee plant on this island, itd provide the people here with new hope and opportunities. But that ingrate denied my request… NOONE SAYS  NO TO ORION.
I had to make an example out of him.

Vermont
You killed the man for some dumb coffee.

Orion
Oh silly, is that what you think? Open your ears~
This town needed a direction, a new leader…me. I was hoping that the mayour would I accept my new construction plans but I had enough.
I Am Orion Von Revitora, billionaire extroidinaire… he was just a lowly frog who though low of me. So I did what I could, the old man had a slight cough you see and I offered him some medicine of my own device. A fiber pill.

Vermont
No… you didnt!

Orion
The sucker, swallowed it with some water and slowly passed before me.
Oh you should have seen it detective, such a wonderful sight.
Seeing your enemies, learn their lesson.

Vermont
You bastard! He was an innocent man, they were all innocent! 

Orion
Tisk tisk… is someone getting a little riled up. 
I think its time for me to help you and your little partner here get some rest.

[Kale bursts from the bushes with Monty following suit]

Kale
You fucker! Your the one who did it and after I trusted you!

Orion
Unhand me! Diesel get them!

[Diesel attempts to break Kale off Orion but Monty interrupts and start fighting]

Orion
You idiot, forget him and help ME. 
Ill kill you and your who fucking family!

[Orion clearly losing the fight, retreats to town. Kale follows suit.]

Kale
Get back here!

Vermont
Kale! No get away from him!

[Monty helps teh player and vermont get out of the pillory. Kale and Orion make it to the town square. Kale blindly continues to throw pucnhes at Orion while he submits.]

Orion
Stop! Please no!

[Kale in a blind rage grabs Orion and waterboards him in the fountain. While Orion was flaily he grabs a fiber pill and swallows it, then swallows the water from the fountain]

[The towns folk watch in horror as Kale chokes Orion until his arm goes limp. Kale, recovering from her rage breathes heavily and takes a few steps back to see what theyve done. Vermont, Player and Monty make it to town and sees teh aftermath]

Townsfolk
Murderer! It was Kale all along! She murdered Orion! How could you! The mayor’s daughter!

Kale
I… I…

[Kale in shock looks at their hands as the police arrive and arrests them]

Chief
Kale Hoppins, you have been arrested and charged for homicide and the murder of Orion.

Kale
Im sorry, I just…

[ Kale looks at Vermont as they are locked into the police car and slowly driven away]

Vermont
Kale… I…damn it

[The town disburse as the remaining officers slowly cover and dispose of Orions body.]

[A few months later in the penetentiary]

Officer 
Kale Hoppins, you bail has been covered. You free to leave.

Kale
What? Who?

[Vermont, Kale and Monty showed up]

Vermont
Hi Kale.

Kale
…Vermont 

[Kale rushes over to Vermont and gives her a hug]

Kale
Im sorry, I knew I shouldnt have… I just didnt

[Vermont gives them a hug]

Vermont
Its ok, I know… you did what you could.

Kale (crying)
Mom, never visited either…. 
I dont think I can go back home, Vermont.

Vermont
… would you like to stay with me?

Kale
?!

Vermont
I have plenty of room at my home, your always welcome to-

Kale
Yes, thank you!

[Kale continues to hug Vermont as Player and Monty watch the two. A few weeks later, the four are tending to Vermont’s garden and Monty notices the sky getting darker than usual With paper started falling from the sky. Vermont hesitates and picked up one of the flier. The flier, painted in blood read “The WishBone Society will return”. The four stare in horror of the new flier and worry about the future of the island.]

Chapter 4

Vermont
Kale is mostly likely with their mother so its best we head back to town hall to gather more information

The Player and Vermont return to the Town hall and meets Madam Hoppins

Madam Hoppins
Welcome back inspectors
Did you manage to find anything?

Vermont
We managed to get more Intel from the town’s folk, but we just have a few details we’d like to confirm if you don't mind.

Madam Hoppins
Of Course, I’d like to help however I can

Vermont
That’s very thoughtful of you ma'am

[Player Options]
- Orion, Kale, Mayor

If Orion is chosen

Madam Hoppins
My dear, we can’t reveal details regarding our town’s folk. The people who reside here come to escape from their previous lives and start a fresh slate. As much as I have trusted you with this investigation, I just can’t offer you details of that nature.

Vermont
I understand.
Could you possibly give us any details on what he does here?

Madam Hoppins
He owns the Big Beak estate just south of town near the pier. He’s helped many residents find homes, so his services have greatly helped our small town.

Vermont
I'm sure he has.
Thank you so much Madam, we will be on our way

Madam Hoppins
Take care.

[The investigator and Player go to the parking lot outside]

Vermont
Something about her feels off to me. 
Very quick to defend the townsfolk once we have mentioned Orion. It’s just a hunch but I think there’s more to this man than it seems based on Pudding’s findings.

[ Vermont and player hear clanging and noises in the background. A wild Kale appears]

Kale
Hey, how is it going fellas

Vermont
Kale?!

Kale
What? Oh, yeah that’s me.

Vermont
Are you OK?

Kale
Fine, just had a quick run and now I am back in action Woo!

Vermont
[Player- I think he’s intoxicated in some way and wreaks of coffee. This might be our chance to get some Intel]
I'm glad!

Kale
So, what're you guys doing here?! Chatting with my mom

Vermont
Um, yes, we spoke to her earlier about a few matters.
Kale do you by any chance know Orion?

Kale
Pssh, course I know him. Used to run a few errands for the guy.

Vermont
Errands?

Kale
Yeah, being the kid of the towns politicians gets a little boring.
So, I go out and take odd jobs here and there.

Vermont
What kind of jobs did you do for Orion?

Kale
The dude pays well so I just do whatever he asks. Cleaning, lawn work, you know the usual.

Vermont
So, he just hires you to do some cleaning.

Kale
Those are the only job I take from him.
My mom hates the guy, thinks he’s real shady so I try to keep my distance.

Vermont
Shady? Has he done anything weird to you?

Kale
Well.
Nothing to me, but the way he acts makes me feel as if, it’s just a mask he’s hiding behind. And I’d rather not joke around with him and find out what’s underneath it.

Vermont
Hm, seems like the people here are afraid of this Orion fellow.

Vermont
How long has he lived here?

Kale
Oh, he just got here a few months back. 
Got real chumming with the people here and now he’s got his own little fan club. 
It’s kind of weird now that you mention it.

Vermont
I see. Do you know where he is right now?

Kale
Probably at his estates down the street. Hes a big fluffy guy, can’t miss him.

Vermont
Thank you, Kale

Kale
No biggie. 
Also, uh, don't tell mom what I told you guys…
I don't usually get much freedom and things have gotten pretty rocky since dad. You know.

Vermont
Your secrets safe with us.

Kale
Thank you.

[ The two arrive near the condo and spot two shadowy figures facing each other]

Cyrus
I'm sorry sir, I'm late again this month. I promise I’ll pay you back

???Oh, don't worry son. I'm just glad that you’re doing well these days. 
How’s Paige and the cafe.

Cyrus
She’s doing great and the coffee you gave us is doing wonder for sales recently.
People just can’t stop drinking the stuff its insane, like…
What your secret ingredient man??

???
Ha-ha, that’s something you’d have to figure out on your own.
What good is a businessman if he gives away all his secrets.

Cyrus
That’s true, I'm sorry Mr. Orion

Orion
No need. It’s getting dark now, how about we head in and discuss all this another time.

Cyrus
Sure, well, have a good night, sir!

Orion 
You are too!

[ Cyrus leaves the scene]

Orion
I see you’ve decided to stop by for a visit, Vermont, [Player]

Player and Vermont
?!

Vermont
I didn't think we were invited.

Orion
Nonsense, everyone is welcome here.
I take it you aren't here for a special tour aren't you detective

Vermont
You seem to know who we are before we even got the chance to introduce ourselves.

Orion
With the ehem recent incident with our beloved mayor. Word tends to go around pretty quickly, especially about a certain detective and their partner roaming about.

Vermont
…
I'm guessing we aren't as welcomed as you made out to be.

Orion
I wouldn't say that.
You just happened to be in the neighborhood and…well
For the sake of my tenants, I'm going to ask you kindly to leave the premises.

Vermont
?!
But we have said anything?

Orion
I think your presence has done enough. 
If you don’t, I’ll have no choice but to use force.

Vermont
I can assure you there’s no need for that.
We would just like to request an offer of your time.

Orion
And I'm afraid I’d have to offer you to leave.

??
What’s going on here?

Vermont and Player
??

Vermont
What the who?!

[ Orion disappears behind the blinding light]

Vermont
We mean no harm, were just here to meet Orion her-

[Vermont notices that Orion flees the scene, but the wet pavement is there]

???
…No one else is here but the two of you

Vermont
It seems our conversation got cut short. We will be on our way now

???
Upupup, not so fast. You’re coming with me.
Can’t let two wanders go under Neighborhood watch’s patrol.

[ The two are escorted to the pier with the neighborhood watch patrol officer]

???
I’ve been seeing you two wandering around lately.

Vermont
Forgive the rudeness but I believe we are owed an introduction of some kind.
We were meeting with the Mr. Orion and now dragged to the other side of town.

Monty
Alright, just to make things easier. 
My name is Monty, I run the pier near the coast of town and part of the neighborhood watch. I scout the area and try my best to keep the folks here safe.

Vermont
How many people are in this neighborhood watch of yours?

Monty
Oh, it’s just me for the time being. Not many people are eager to walk around at night for creeps. Especially with all the…recent incidents.

Vermont
I take it you speak of the incident with the mayor

Monty
Have you been living under a rock or something?
Yes, the mayor’s case is the biggest one yet but… folks around here have gone missing too. And I hate to say it, but a few folks may be suspecting that the two of you may be involved.

Vermont
We are investigators tasked by Madam Hoppins to investigate the case of her late husband. Why in the world would we do such a thing?

Monty
Well, it’s not you and your partner folks are worried about. 
It’s just you, tall badger wandering around town does draw suspicion.

Vermont
I’ve lived here for a few months; I would never hurt anyone.

Monty
I get that, but with a small town it’s easy for folks to recognize newcomers and locals.

Vermont
Are you saying that I may have something to do with the missing cases?

Monty
Don't get me wrong officer, I'm not one to judge but picture this.
If you were living in a small town of let’s, say 5-10 folks and someone new stops by, people would immediately know that you’re not from around here. 
Now let’s say that missing people started to disappear one after the other during the time when this newcomer is conveniently not in town.

Vermont
With all due respect, I'm here to retire peacefully.
I have no intentions to harm anyone on this island and that fact that people are accusing me of such thing is insulting.

Monty
Your being insulted by rumors then
Just as how you were offended by these accusations, nothing is confirmed. 
But I take it, if the mayor’s wife tasked you to investigate the mayor’s murder, then I assume there’s more to meet the eyes.

Vermont
…
This all feels like an interrogation. 
How can someone in the neighborhood watch know so much about these sorts of thing anyway. 

Monty
You’re not the only one who’s not from here who came for a peaceful life inspector.

Vermont
…

Monty
I’ve seen my fair share of misjudgment in my life.
An old soul like me gets tired of it after a while.

Vermont
I take it you’re from off the island as well.

Monty
Yup, used to be a professional wrestler back in the good old days.
Things got a little rough so came here not too long ago.

Vermont
What happened?

Monty
Sigh... 40 years ago, I was the national champion in my league.
Traveled far and wide to every tournament in the world and always made it to the top. 
“Mad Dog Monty” is what they used to call me.

Vermont
Mad Dog huh, back in the field they used to call me “Vermont the Vacant”

Monty
Vacant?

Vermont
Yeah, I used to work in private investigations for 40 years. Always found the killer no matter what. I was told that with every case I’d give a blank look. As if I'm a predator stalking their prey or something.

Monty
He-he, I know that feeling.
People in the ring always got that look from me. Scare the crap out of them but I didn't mind all too much. 
So uh, if things were so good what made you come all the way out here?

Vermont
…
Despite the nick name, things didn't feel right. 
You can only get reports of innocent people getting hurt for so long. All the trials, the phone calls, the testimonies… it eats away at your sanity one by one.
At first, I joined the force to help the community, but at the cost I lost everything… my sanity, my will to live. Only after losing my late wife that I had to retire and leave the town I valiantly served.

Monty
Sound rough, I'm uh, sorry that happened to you.

Vermont
It’s nothing to apologize for, if anything I’m sorry you had to hear this old soul ramble about the past.

Monty
I wouldn't say that.
Went through kind of the same thing as well.
A few years ago, I decided one last match before the road, things were changing about me that I didn't like. On my final match, things were heating up as usual, one more punch and the belt is mine but…something took over that day.
I felt a rush. Things went dark and before I knew it my opponent was down on the ground with a gaping bit would…from me.

Vermont
You bit him?

Monty
I didn't mean to!
I don't know what happened but since that day I ran. Ran as far as I could.
What happened, why did I bite him. 
I was scared but most of all I was scared of myself.
I him away from the public and word got around that I murdered the guy.

Vermont
If you felt so guilty, why didn't you turn yourself in.

Monty
You know from a cop’s point of view; it'd be that easy but… look at me.
People like me don't get a slap on the wrist for an accidental bite. 
They were going to kill me.

Vermont
Oh.

Monty
I knew that if I stayed where I was that if they ever caught me, I’d never see the light of day. I didn't want to leave, that was my home…

Vermont
What did you do?

Monty
…
I paid an old friend a visit at the hospital. The guy I bit.
Luckily, he was recovering well and forgave me, but even with that I couldn't forgive myself. I loved wrestling but I’d never hurt a fly outside the ring.
Once I said my goodbyes, I headed to the shore and swam…swam as far away as possible. 
Washed up on this right here island and Mayor Hoppins took me in.
Folks were afraid of me but eventually warmed up to me. 
Hoppins wanted me to be his official bodyguard, but I couldn't risk it, not like what happened last time. So, I offered to run this here pier and run neighborhood watch and here we are.

Vermont
You've been through quite a lot of Monty.

Monty
Yeah, you got me crying over here in front of a bunch of people I don't even know.

Vermont
I understand though Monty.
You don't want anyone to be harmed in anyway, even if it meant isolating yourself. 
Believing that the only way to keep a peaceful life is to isolate yourself as much as possible until your final breathes…
But there’s definitely more out there for you. 
The town might be small, but we've met some great people who care about this town just as much as you do…and if you ever need a friend, I'm here for you.
I know what it’s like to be treated differently and…as hard as things might be…it gets better, I promise

Monty 
You know, for a cop. You’re not so bad yourself

Vermont
When you've been in the field this long, you've seen a lot.
But what hurts the most is seeing your fellow officers treat the people they protect like dust.
I solemnly promise that my partner and I haven't he towns best interest at heart and would never hurt anyone. However, this final case is big.

Monty
I know. 

Vermont
We can’t allow things to keep going like this and for more and more people we care about to get hurt.
Madam tasked me to find the culprit and end this. Apologies if I seemed suspicious speaking to Mr. Orion but that fellow just feels off.

Monty
I thought I was the only one who thought that.

Vermont
You too?!

Monty
He’s new around here. A rich tycoon who drifted a little offshore and discovers the island. He funded a few living spaces for the town and people love him.

Vermont
I’ve heard.

Monty
But think about it, a billionaire just conveniently wanders into town and now he’s got a whole fan club.

Vermont
Do you think he’s up to something?

Monty
No doubt it, I’ve met my fair share of rich folk back in my career and if there’s one thing, I’ve learned is that no one’s truly satisfied with what they have. People like that always crave more.

Vermont
Why didn't you report him to the police?

Monty
Vermont, do you hear yourself.
People look at me and would think in the killer over here. 
A man of that much power isn't a person you can just report to the police and get away scot free.

Vermont
Your right. What we need is hard evidence that this Orion fellow is up to something. 
But no matter what we try, we can’t seem to get any concrete evidence besides rumors.

Monty
I know I said I wouldn't be involved. But I’ve noticed something weird on my usual patrols. I’ve seen folks wander around the woods holding sacks of some kind.

Vermont
Sacks? Could you describe the person you saw holding it?

Monty
Sharks don't have good eyesight but that bag, wreaked of meat and roses. 

Vermont
Roses… The receptionist, Phara?!
[Player] we need to leave now

Monty
Where are you going?

Vermont
Thank you so much Monty but we need to leave now.
Oh, and if you ever need a friend to chat with, I live just north from here. Stop by for some tea sometime!

Monty
He-he will do.

[ Vermont and Player rush off to the salon now that the newest suspect has been reveled]

CHAPTER 3

[Vermont and their assistant make their way to the salon just a few blocks from the cafe. There they greet with melodious chimes from the door and met the receptionist]

VERMONT
Hi, Inspector Vermont with the local Police. I would like to speak with you regarding intel on a regular at your salon.

PHARA
Oh no no no no. Not here.
I am tired of your police folk coming in here interrupting my business.

VERMONT
This town's really friendly... I am sorry ma'am, we'll be out of your way shortly, we just need to speak to someone for a moment.

PHARA
If ya aint here for business, then I suggest you leave.

VERMONT
Oh dear... we need to speak to a few people in the area, but the receptionist is not the friendliest. How do we do this?

[ Player Options]

VERMONT
Good idea! Ma'am, would it be possible to have a quick pedicure while were here. My colleague and I have been walking quite a bit and it would be nice to treat ourselves even for just a few minutes.

PHARA
Hmm... I do not trust ya, but my shop needs the customers...Fine. Sit over there and I will have Puddin' take care of yah. 

[ Vermont and player are escorted to their chairs to get their pedicure]

PUDDING
Welcome.

VERMONT
Oh, hello there!

PUDDING
Pedicure for two? Feet in the tray please. 

VERMONT
You must be pudding it is a pleasure to meet you.

PUDDING
...

VERMONT
I take it that I am not welcomed here. [Player] could you help me out with this situation?	We need as much intel as possible, and I take it that they trust you more.

[PLAYER SECTION:
(Option 1: Pleasure to meet you Pudding!

Pudding
Hello
Option 2: How long have you worked here?
	
Pudding: 
I have worked here all my life. I care for big people.	

Player: 
Big People?	

Pudding:
 Large folk with claws and sharp teeth.
	
Vermont: 
Ah, strange that she describes people like that...	

Option 3: What do you do outside of work?
	
Pudding: 
I... do not really go anywhere. This job is all I am good at. 

Option 4: Do you go out to meet other people?	
Pudding: 
I have tried but someone like me doesn’t get by that easily here. I was adopted by my grandparents and grew up here. 	

Option 5: I am sorry about Vermont	

Player:
 I am sorry if my partner scared you. She means no harm.	

Pudding: ...]

VERMONT
Ms. Pudding, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Vermont, terribly sorry if I spooked you earlier.

PUDDING
You are the inspector from across the street.

VERMONT
Huh?

PUDDING
I have seen you walking around talking to everyone. You spoke to Cyrus, and she looked scared. I thought you were going to do something to them

VERMONT
Oh, not at all. Apologies! [ She is gotta sharp eye on things]	So I’m assuming you know why we’re here?

PUDDING
Yes. But we must be quiet, the walls have ears.

VERMONT
...

PUDDING
Of course, ma'am, one moment while I give you a haircut.

VERMONT
[playing along] Hope it is not too much of a bother ha-ha, it’s been a while since I’ve had a haircut!

[Pudding turns on the blow dryer]
[Pudding leans into their ears]

PUDDING
My livelihood is at stake speaking to you two. You must promise me to not get me involved if anything else happens?

[Vermont clears their throat]

PUDDING
I’m not sure how useful this is, but I had a client come in recently looking suspiciously calm.

VERMONT
Calm?

PUDDING
I can’t describe it beyond that but when he came in, he requested a private pedicure.

VERMONT
I see.

PUDDING
I’ve never seen him around town before, so I thought he was a tourist. We don’t get many of them around here so thought he was just nervous and needed something to calm himself. I took on the request and did his pedicure. He took off his shoes and it was covered in cement. 

VERMONT
Cement?

PUDDING
I am not sure if he was involved in a construction accident but I am assuming that was the reason he was so riled up about.

VERMONT
Do you have a name?

PHARA
Pudding! Hurry up with those two, wave got a few more clients coming in

PUDDING
Yes, Ma'am. Follow me up front.

[The two dried off and went to the front desk to pay while pudding ran the register]

PUDDING
That will be $40.

[Pudding lifts a book onto the front desk and points at a name &quot;Orion&quot;]

VERMONT
That was an excellent massage, ma'am. Have a good day.

PUDDING
Thank you for stopping by.

[The player and Vermont left the spa]

VERMONT
Orion... does that name sound familiar to you?
