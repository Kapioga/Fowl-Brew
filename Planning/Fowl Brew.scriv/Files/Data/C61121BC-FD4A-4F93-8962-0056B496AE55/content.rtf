\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vermont}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yeah, I used to work in private investigations for 40 years. Always found the killer no matter what. I was told that with every case Id give a blank look. As if I'm a predator stalking their prey or something.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Monty}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He-he, I know that feeling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 People in the ring always got that look from me. Scare the crap out of them but I didn't mind all too much. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Monty}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I wouldn't say that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Went through kind of the same thing as well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few years ago, I decided one last match before the road, things were changing about me that I didn't like. On my final match, things were heating up as usual, one more punch and the belt is mine but\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85something took over that day.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I felt a rush. Things went dark and before I knew it my opponent was down on the ground with a gaping bit would\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85from me.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I didn't mean to!}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I don't know what happened but since that day I ran. Ran as far as I could.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What happened, why did I bite him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I was scare but most of all I was scared of myself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I him away from the public and word got around that I murdered the guy.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vermont}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You know from a cop\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s point of view, it'd be that easy but\u8230\'85 look at me.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 People like me don't get a slap on the wrist for an accidental bite. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were gonna kill me.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vermont}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Oh.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Monty}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I knew that if I stayed where I was that if they ever caught me, Id never see the light of day. I didn't wanna leave, that was my home\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I paid an old friend a visit at the hospital. The guy I bit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Luckily he was recovering well and forgave me, but even with that I couldn't forgive myself. I loved wrestling but Id never hurt a fly outside the ring.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once I said my goodbyes, I headed to the shore and swam\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85swam as far away as possible. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Washed up on this right here island and Mayor Hoppins took me in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Folks were afraid of me but eventually warmed up to me. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hoppins wanted me to be his official bodyguard but I couldn't risk it, not like what happened last time. So I offered to run this here pier and run neighborhood watch and here we are.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vermont}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You've been through quite a lot Monty.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Monty}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yeah, you got me crying over here in front of a bunch of people I don't even know.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vermont}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I understand though Monty.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You don't want anyone to be harmed in anyway, even if it meant isolating yourself. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Believing that the only way to keep a peaceful life is to isolate yourself as much as possible until your final breathe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But theres definitely more out there for you. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The town might be small but we've met some great people who care about this town just as much as you do\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85and if you ever need a friend, I'm here for you.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I know what its like to be treated differently and\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85as hard as things might be\u8230\'85it gets better, I promise}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When you've been in the field this long, you've seen a lot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But what hurts the most is seeing your fellow officers treat the people they protect like dust.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Your right. What we need is hard evidence that this Orion fellow is up to something. }
