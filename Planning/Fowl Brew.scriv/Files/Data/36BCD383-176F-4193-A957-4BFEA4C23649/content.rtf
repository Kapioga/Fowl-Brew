Its clearly needed for our investigation!\tab Plus, she\u8217\'92s a civilian. We shouldn\u8217\'92t be running around causing mass panic just because were looking for a murderer. The best thing we can do is to keep the peace as best as we can. }

Kind of grasping at straws here but I think our next best bet is to check it out. }
